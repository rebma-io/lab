# About

rebma.io is a label for Maker projects.

WARNING: **Not a Professional Engineer** While I have been an engineer
of various forms for the last 30+ years, I am not a [professional
engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_and_licensure_in_engineering),
and much of the information here is self-taught and not formally
educated. Just keep that in mind as you read.
## Why

Being a maker means learning a dizzying number of skills, and as part of the
spirit of the community I wanted to share things that I've learned, found, and
otherwise hope others might find some use.

## Who

The content in this collection is written by Chris Petrilli. An engineer of 30
years in the tech business working in software, security, and embedded
systems. 

## Amazon, Affiliate Links and Such

There are no affiliate links on this website. I don't get any money off of
anything you click on. I've also tried to point people at the original
manufacturer, rather than just throw it at Amazon. Amazon can be a life saver
for hard to find things, but they're still not a particularly ethical
organization to do business with.

## Analytics

I do use some basic analytics (powered by [Fathom
Analytics](https://usefathom.com)), which is [much more privacy
focused](https://usefathom.com/privacy-focused-web-analytics), and only collects
the barest minimum of information. I don't even see IP addresses.

## Built With

The site is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and the [Material for
MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme (although it's much
bigger than that). It is edited (primarily) in [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), written in
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) and also using [Jupyter
notebooks](https://jupyter.org). Finally, it is hosted on Github Pages.
