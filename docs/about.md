# About

![rebma.io logo](assets/rebma-io-logo-black.png){: width=240 align=right }

rebma.io is a label for Maker projects.

WARNING: **Not a Professional Engineer** While I have been an engineer
of various forms for the last 30+ years, I am not a [professional
engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_and_licensure_in_engineering),
and much of the information here is self-taught and not formally
educated. Just keep that in mind as you read. My curiosity may be nearly
limitless, but my understanding always has limits. I'll try to point
these out wherever I can.

## Why

Being a maker means learning a dizzying number of skills, and as part of the
spirit of the community I wanted to share things that I've learned, found, and
otherwise hope others might find some use.

## Who

The content in this collection is written by Chris Petrilli. An engineer of 30
years in the tech business working in software, security, and embedded
systems. Where the content comes from someone else, I have endeavoured to
make sure it is linked to the original source.

## Amazon, Affiliate Links and Such

There are no affiliate links on this website. I don't get any money off of
anything you click on. I've also tried to point people at the original
manufacturer, rather than just throw it at Amazon. Amazon can be a life saver
for hard to find things, but they're still not a particularly ethical
organization to do business with.

## Analytics

I do use some basic analytics (powered by [Fathom
Analytics](https://usefathom.com)), which is [much more privacy
focused](https://usefathom.com/privacy-focused-web-analytics), and only collects
the barest minimum of information. I don't even see IP addresses.

## Built With

The site is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and the [Material for
MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme (although it's much
bigger than that). It is edited (primarily) in [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), written in
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) and also using [Jupyter
notebooks](https://jupyter.org). Finally, it is hosted on Github Pages.

In addition, throughout, you'll find interactive circuit simulators.
These were built on top of Paul Falstad's [brilliant
circuitjs](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/). I also took a bunch of the
example circuits and have used them as a starting point for discussion.
More details can be found on [this
page](electronics/simulating-circuits.md).
