# Waterproofing 

The prints you get out of a FFF printer are highly unlikely to be
waterproof. If they are, it's mostly an accident. While there won't be a
huge amount of leakage, there will likely be some. For most uses, this
doesn't matter, but it could matter if, for example, you're printing a
lovely vase. You need it to hold water, or the flowers will die.

To waterproof, you've got a few options:

* Epoxy resin coating. There is a [Youtube video on the
  process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyhGxJr_A0Y). 
* Wax (note, Gulf Wax melts at approximately 130F)
* Acetone (ABS, ASA, etc. not PLA/PETG)
* Silicone conformal coating (like from MG Chemicals)
* Clear spray paint, like Rustoleum Universal Clear

TODO: Show how to use a few of these, ideally with step-by-step
instructions.
