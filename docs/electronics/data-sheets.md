# Data Sheets

NOTE: **Math Ahead** There's some math ahead. It's not math for data
sheets, but specifically math for regulators. You should be able to
follow along as I've tried to be as explicit as possible along the way.

## What is a Data Sheet

A data sheet is a document that the manufacturer of an electronic
component, whether it be a simple passive (e.g., resistor, capacitor,
inductor), or something active like a semiconductor, puts all the
details of the behavior of the component and how to use it properly.
Obviously the data sheet for a complicated micro-controller will be much
larger than the one for a capacitor, but they are, typically, organized
in similar ways.

## Where to Find Them

The two best places to find a data sheet are either from the
manufacturer themselves (every manufacturer has a decent web presence at
this point), or from the distributor. The link above is from TI's
website directly. In addition, every major
[supplier](suppliers.md#ics-passives-etc) will typically have links to
the data sheet for the parts they carry. For example, if you go to the
[Digikey page for the
LM317LCLPR](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/LM317LCLPR/668552)
(more on those weird letters later), they have a link to the data sheet
for that exact part.

Lastly, you can always just search "LM317 data sheet" on your favorite
search engine, and you'll typically get the right thing. This can be
especially helpful when you're buying random parts from eBay,
AliExpress, or other less official distributors.
[Octopart](https://octopart.com) also is a good way to find them, as
they'll typically have a link.


## How to Read Them

If you download the [LM317](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm317.pdf)
(PDF) data sheet, you can follow along. We will start with the top-level
sections and go into them each in turn. Along the way, we'll discuss
some aspects of linear regulators to be aware of in this context.

### Header

![TI LM317 header, upper right](/img/datasheet-lm317-header.png){: width=300 align=right }

In the header, the manufacturer provides information like the official
part number and name, as well as (typically) the first release date
and the latest revision date of the data sheet. In this one, we can see
it was first released in September of 1997 and updated in April of 2020.
It's actually not that unusual to find data sheets where the part was
released 30+ years ago.

### Features

The features provide a _device-specific_ overview of the
things most people will care about when selecting the device. Does it
have any unique characteristics? 

> * Output voltage range adjustable from 1.25 V to 37 V
> * Output current greater than 1.5 A
> * Internal short-circuit current limiting
> * Thermal overload protection
> * Output safe-area compensation

From this data sheet, we can see that it has an adjustable output range
from 1.25 to 37V, and can deliver _at least_ 1.5A, and it has multiple
internal safety mechanisms. 

### Applications

Recommendation applications, but not necessarily all of the
applications. In many ways, this is just marketing; but, if it talks
about "military" or "aerospace", you at least know you've got your hands
on a very expensive part, and you might want to look elsewhere. This
_can_ read like a laundry list with some vendors, but it can also be a
neat set of ideas that you might not have thought of.

### Description

A prosaic overview of what the device is. For this device, we get:

> The LM317 device is an adjustable three-terminal positive-voltage
> regulator capable of supplying more than 1.5 A over an output-voltage
> range of 1.25 V to 37 V. It requires only two external resistors to
> set the output voltage. The device features a typical line regulation
> of 0.01% and typical load regulation of 0.1%. It includes current
> limiting, thermal overload protection, and safe operating area
> protection. Overload protection remains functional even if the ADJUST
> terminal is disconnected.

There's a few things here that aren't in the _Features_ section. For
example, we now know we'll need two resistors to set the output voltage,
and that it has line and load regulation tolerance of 0.1%. _Line
regulation_ is the ability of the device to maintain a constant output
voltage even with a varying input voltage. For example, the device
should deliver 3.3V whether it's being driven with 4V or 12V. _Load
regulation_ is closely related, but it is the ability to maintain a
constant voltage when the _load_ (think amps) is varying. 

There's also a little detail about how the protection works. The three
types of protection this device includes are:

* _Current limiting_. This means the device will limit the amount of
  current that it delivers to ensure safety under all circumstances. For
  example, if you were to short the device, it will ensure it behaves
  properly. 
* _Thermal overload protection_. The device will have protections to
  ensure that if it gets too hot, it will shut itself off to keep from
  having permanent damage. This is typically anything far outside the
  _recommended operating temperature_.
* _Safe operating area_. Safe operating area (SOA) is something unique
  to power devices (think transistors of many types). It is the
  current and voltage conditions where it can be expected to operate
  without damage. 

A quick read of this section is going to tell you whether this part is
likely to work for your application or not.

### Part Number & Device Information

![LM317 device and part
information](/img/datasheet-lm317-device-information.png){: width=400 align=left }

A listing of all the variations of the part that the company produces.
These may differ in specification, packaging, or both. It may not be
exhaustive, but is typically the "main" versions. Some data sheets will
have this on the front page or two, and others will have it near the
end. Earlier, I said we'd come to the weird string of letters at the end
of the "LM317". This is where you might find the details.

From this, we can see that the part comes in 3 different packages:
TO-220 (3 pins), TO-263 (3 pins), SOT-223 (4 pins). In this case, the TO
stands for "Transistor Outline", and the TO-220 package is a
through-hole (THT) package, while the TO-263 is surface mount (SMD). The
SOT-223 is just a "Small Outline Transistor" package, which is another
(even smaller) SMD package.

You can see the various sizes in this chart as well.

### Revision History

A list of all the changes to the data sheet. Typically, these are just
clarifications, although occasionally some vendors will sneak in an
important change to the characteristics or behavior of the component in
a revision to the data sheet. _This is evil_.

### Device (Comparison) Table

![LM317 device comparison table](/img/datasheet-lm317-comparison-table.png)

Here we can find information on all the variations on the part from a
specification perspective, along with the critical characteristics for
those variations. A few notes about this one.

First, you can see it's grouped into 3 groups along the $I_{out}$
dimensions. This is the maximum current that the device can produce
safely. For example, the LM317M is only designed for 0.5A. 

NOTE: **Tolerance** I'm going to talk about tolerance here, and, in the
future, will discuss it in more detail because it's something that often
trips up engineers. One thing, especially, to be aware of is [tolerance
stacking](https://www.fastradius.com/resources/tolerance-stacking-101/).
Although this discusses it in a different context, the idea is similar.

If we take the 1.5A primary parts, we can see a few things that differ.
First, regulation accuracy differs. Earlier, I mentioned line and load
regulation tolerance of 0.1%, so why does this say 1-1.5%? Well, the
tolerance is about how the regulated output behaves under different
input voltages and output loads. The regulation accuracy is how close to
whatever you've set it to (let's say 3.3V) it actually hits. For 1.5%,
this means 3.3V Â±0.0495, or a value between 3.2505 and 3.3495. Good
enough for nearly every use case.

We can also see that some devices have a wider operating temperature
range than others, and you can just assume those will cost you
(sometimes substantially) more. Another dimension discussed here is PSRR
(at 120Hz). This is the power supply rejection ratio, and is nearly
always specified in [decibels](units-of-measure.md). Simplified, this is
the ability of the device to reduce input supply noise in its output.
Noise can be thought of as just the variations in the input supply. For
example, in poorly isolated circuits, you can get [mains
frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_frequency) showing up
in the DC side of the circuit.

Finally, there are several lines (per package) that mention $T_{JA}$,
which is often written as $\theta_{JA}$. Either way, this is the
_thermal resistance_ between the junction of the transistor and ambient
temperature. Where does this come in? Mostly if you want to calculate
the allowed power dissipation ($P_{D(max)}$), where you use this
equation: 

$$P_{D(max)} = {{T_{J(max)} -T_A}\over{\theta_{JA}}}$$

Where $T_{J(max)}$ is the maximum junction temperature, $T_A% is the
ambient temperature the device is operating in, and we take
$\theta_{JA}$ from before. 

But honestly, you don't need to worry about this most of the time. Just
stay within the operating temperature of the device, and you'll be fine
(enough). 

### Pin Configurations and Functions

![LM317 pin
configuration](/img/datasheet-lm317-packaging-and-pins.png){: width=400 align=right }

For every packaging option, there _should_ be a diagram showing the
package, and the pin assignment. These often change package to package,
so pay attention. Below this, we can find a table showing 1) whether
this is an input or output pin, and 2) a description of it. So we can
see the supply (input) is on pin 3, the output is on pin 2, and pin 1
has the resistor divider network to set the output voltage.


### Specifications

![LM317 load regulation graph at -40, 25, and
125C](/img/datasheet-lm317-load-regulation.png){: width=400 align=left}

In this section we can find, typically, very detailed technical
information about the component. For example, the $T_{J(max)}$ mentioned
earlier, various ESD ratings, and lots of thermal information.  The one
thing to take from this section for the LM317 is the $V_I - V_O$ delta,
which must be between 3 and 40V. This means, to get a 3.3V output, you
need to feed it _at least_ 6.3V in.

Finally, you'll also find in-depth electrical characteristics about the
component. More about the line and load regulation discussed earlier, as
well as various power quality specifications. When dealing with the
better manufacturers, these will typically include graphs of important
characteristics, such as the load regulation shown here. This shows the
output voltage (10V nominal) at certain output current loads at -40, 25,
and 125C.

### Detailed Description

Here we find a lot of useful information. We also find out a few details:

* Connecting a fixed (single) resistor between the output and adjust
  terminals, we can convert the regulator into a _current regulator_.
* An output capacitor (between output and ground) is recommended to
  improve transient response. Basically, the (bypass) capacitor acts as
  a tiny battery for sudden surges in output. 
* The adjust terminal can be bypassed (capacitor) to achieve very high
  ripple-rejection ratios. Ripple rejection is the ability of an
  amplifier to maintain accurate output voltage despite AC fluctuations
  in the power supply.

![LM317 functional block diagram](/img/datasheet-lm317-block-diagram.png){: width=400 align=right }

We also get a functional block diagram. This isn't how the device is
actually built, but is often the idealized version of it. What it will
show you, though is what the main pieces inside the component are. Here
we can see that it consists of a current source, an operational
amplifier (opamp), a
[Darlington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlington_transistor) (NPN)
transistor, a resistor, and a [Zener
diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode). Examining this will
give us a good understanding of how to use the component properly, but
also how all the pieces fit together.

We also discover a few different operating modes of the device,
specifically how it behaves in normal, low voltage, and low (current)
load. 

### Applications and Implementation

Here's where we find the real meat of how to work with the component.
The first is the _typical application_. You should think of this as the
manufacturers strongly worded recommendation on how to use the
component. _Ingenium cave._

![LM317 typical application
schematic](/img/datasheet-lm317-typical-application.png)

In this situation, we have both a schematic and a series of
recommendations: 

> * R1 and R2 are required to set the output voltage.
> * $C_{ADJ}$ is recommended to improve ripple rejection. It prevents
>   amplification of the ripple as the output voltage is adjusted
>   higher.
> * $C_i$ is recommended, particularly if the regulator is not in close
>   proximity to the power-supply filter capacitors. A 0.1-Î¼F or 1-Î¼F
>   ceramic or tantalum capacitor provides sufficient bypassing for most
>   applications, especially when adjustment and output capacitors are
>   used.
> * $C_O$ improves transient response, but is not needed for stability.
> * Protection diode D2 is recommended if $C_{ADJ}$ is used. The diode
>   provides a low-impedance discharge path to prevent the capacitor
>   from discharging into the output of the regulator.
> * Protection diode D1 is recommended if $C_O$ is used. The diode
>   provides a low-impedance discharge path to prevent the capacitor
>   from discharging into the output of the regulator.

From this, we can surmise that to implement a LM317-based regulator
circuit the way TI recommends, we will need 2 resistors (to set the
voltage output), a couple of capacitors, and a couple of 1N4002 diodes
for protection.  

NOTE: **Manufacturer versus Hobbyist; Prototype v Production** It's
important to remember that the manufacturer is trying to show the best
possible way to use their component. This doesn't mean it's the only way
to use it, but you would be well served to follow the advice if you
don't understand why you might not. For example, if we were just
puttering on a prototype board, we might leave the capacitors out, which
would allow us to also leave out the diodes. But we shouldn't do that if
we end up turning it into a PCB. 

We are then given the equation to set the output voltage using the two
resistors:

$$V_O = V_{ref} ({1 + {R_2\over R_1}) + (I_{adj} \times R_2)}$$

There's also a little note that $I_{adj}$ is typically only 50uA, and
therefore almost irrelevant since (assuming R2 is 220 ohm): $0.00005
\times 220 = 0.011$, and the $V_{ref} = 1.25V$,  so we can simplify the
equation to:

$$V_O = 1.25 ({1 + {R_2\over R_1}})$$

Let's re-arrange so we can solve for just one of the resistors:

$$R_1 = R_1({{V_O \over 1.25} - 1})$$

Now, let's assume we want 5V as an output:

$$\begin{aligned}
R_2 &= R_1({{5\over 1.25} - 1})\\[5pt]
&= R_1(4 - 1)\\[5pt]
&= R_1 \times 3
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, if we just stick in 100 ohms for $R_1$, we get $R_2 = 300$. So we
need R2 to be 300 ohms when R1 is 100 ohms. If we go back to the
original equation, and we assume $I_{adj} = 50\mu A$, then we get:

$$\begin{aligned}
V_O &= V_{ref} {({1 + {R_2\over R_1}}) + (I_{adj} \times R_2)}\\[5pt]
&= 1.25 ({1 + {300\over 100}}) + (0.00005 \times 100)\\[5pt]
&= 1.25 ({1 + 3}) + 0.005\\[5pt]
&= 1.25\times 4 + 0.005\\[5pt]
&= 5.005
\end{aligned}
$$

So, we are over by $5.005/5.000 = 0.1%$. It should also be noted that
you typically want the lowest value resistors that can work here, even
though you could use 1k and 3k to achieve the same thing.

NOTE: **Showing Your Work** I just want to acknowledge Ms. Clayton, my
highschool calculus teacher who repeatedly reprimanded me for not
"showing my work" when I did assignments. Here's my work; you were
right.

The rest of this section has a bunch of example circuits for various
applications.  You often will find something that is either exactly, or
very close, to what you're looking for.  Use it if you can.


### Recommendations

> The LM317 is designed to operate from an input voltage supply range
> between 1.25 V to 37 V greater than the output voltage. If the device
> is more than six inches from the input filter capacitors, an input
> bypass capacitor, 0.1 Î¼F or greater, of any type is needed for
> stability.

A couple takeaways:

* We need 1.25-37V _more_ input voltage than output voltage. There are
  other devices (called LDO, or low drop-out regulators) which need much
  less.
* If we're more than 6" from the input filter capacitor, we should use a
  0.1uF bypass on the input. 

Simple enough.

### Layout

First, TI provides some specific recommendations:

> * TI recommends that the input terminal be bypassed to ground with a
>   bypass capacitor.
> * The optimum placement is closest to the input terminal of the device
>   and the system GND. Take care to minimize the loop area formed by
>   the bypass-capacitor connection, the input terminal, and the system
>   GND.
> * For operation at full rated load, TI recommends to use wide trace
>   lengths to eliminate I Ã R drop and heat dissipation.

They then provide an example "layout" for best performance:

![LM317 PCB layout recommendations](/img/datasheet-lm317-pcb-layout.png)

The large grey blocks are intended to be "wide traces" (see
[how to calculate](PCB-design.md#trace-width-and-current-capacity)), and
they show in this specific package (SOT-223) you should connect the two
output pins together with a substantial trace. They also show using a
pair of input capacitors (one for high input, and another to block high
frequency noise). Dave (of EEVblog) did [a great
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xicZF9glH0) showing the effects
of various combinations.


### Device and Documentation Support

This section will contain information on how to stay up-to-date from the
manufacturer and various other miscellaneous information.


### Mechanical, Packaging, and Orderable Information

Finally, we get a list of all the various orderable products:

![List of LM317 orderable
products](/img/datasheet-lm317-package-information.png)'

There's a few things here to pay attention to. The first, and maybe even
the most important is "Status". This is the part's status to the
manufacturer, and for TI they use the following terms:

* ACTIVE. Product device recommended for new designs.
* LIFEBUY. TI has announced that the device will be discontinued, and a
  lifetime-buy period is in effect.
* NRND. Not recommended for new designs. Device is in production to
  support existing customers, but TI does not recommend using this part
  in a new design.
* PREVIEW. Device has been announced but is not in production. Samples
  may or may not be available. 
* OBSOLETE. TI has discontinued the production of the device.

![Digikey product status selector](/img/digikey-product-status.png){: width=200 align=left }

You should, if at all possible, avoid any device which is not shown as
ACTIVE. You're setting yourself up for a lot of future pain and
suffering if you don't. In addition, when searching on a distributor's
website, you should make sure you select "Active" for all searches,
unless you have some _very specific and intentional_ reason not to. The
image to the left shows what it looks like in Digikey's parametric
search

### In Summary

Whew, that's a _lot_ of information. Part of learning electronics,
though, is learning how to quickly skim a data sheet so that you can
find what you need to know. Most of it isn't applicable at any one point
in time, or is simply additional color to the use case. Still, you
should read a few from front-to-back just to familiarize yourself.

If you find a data sheet that feels super light, and it's for one of
those common parts, definitely go looking for another manufacturer's
sheet. While there are important differences, it's likely to be "close
enough" for most use cases.

## What to do if You Can't Find One

TODO: Need to write up more details on what to do in this situation.
Unfortunately, this is somewhat common with a lot of "inexpensive"
parts.
