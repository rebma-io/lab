# Manufacturers

I'm not trying to show every manufacturer out there, as there's
literally tens-of-thousands. Instead, I want to point at a few that I
_personally_ really enjoy working with, or really appreciate the quality
of their products.

* [Texas Instruments](https://ti.com/). One of the oldest surviving
  semiconductor companies. They've absorbed literally hundreds of
  companies over the years, but the main reason I am a big proponent of
  their parts is that they have, by a wide margin, the best data sheets
  and application notes. They're a master-class in understanding how to
  use the components.
* [Mill-Max](https://www.mill-max.com/). Produces very high-quality
  interconnects. For me, it's mostly their spring-loaded components and
  PC terminals.
