# Soldering

## Solder and Flux

Solder is a metal alloy used to create strong permanent bonds such as attaching
components to a PCB, or joining wires together. It comes in two different types,
lead and lead free, and also can be had in a wide variety of diameters
(typically 0.015" to 0.125"). Inside any solder intended for electronics is the
flux, a material used to clean, strengthen, and improve its mechanical
properties.
