# Fusion 360 for Electronics

## Random Bits of knowledge

* Because Fusion 360's ECAD components are basically yanked out of
  EAGLE, you still have access to EAGLE's "command line" interface. That
  means you can do things like `EXPORT IMAGE CLIPBOARD MONOCHROME 300`
  to export a 300dpi monochrome copy of the schematic to the clipboard.
  Sadly, I can't figure out how to put it anywhere useful as a file, so
  I just paste it into something and go from there. [I really should
  read the reference](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?guid=ECD-CLI#export).
