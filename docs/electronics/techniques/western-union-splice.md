# Western-Union Wire Splice

NOTE: This information is all taken from Western Union documents, and
specifically the book, _Practical Electric Wiring_ by John M. Sharp,
published in 1916 (found on
[archive.org](https://archive.org/details/practicalelectr00shargoog/page/n25/mode/2up)).
Yes, it's that old. It's also bullet proof and time-tested.

Recently, in a conversation, I realized that when splicing wires,
there's an old, absolutely bulletproof, way to do it that is also pretty
much the cheapest way to tie two wires together. I woulds strongly
recommend this over pretty much any other solution for simple joins.
While it was developed in the 19th century, it is just as valuable today
as it was 150 years ago.
