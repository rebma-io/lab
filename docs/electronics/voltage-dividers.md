# Voltage Dividers

CONSTRUCTION: This is just under construction and is nowhere near ready
for review, but it's in the repo so I can keep track of it.

INFO: **Limits of Voltage Dividers** Voltage dividers are amazing
things, and you definitely will want to use a lot of them. They do have
their limitations though. Typically, a voltage divider is only useful
up to a small number of milliamps (mA). Above that, you absolutely need
a different solution, like a voltage regulator.

## Choosing Resistor Decades

_Current is king_. As is always the case.

TIP: **Where to Start** For &micro;A loads, I'd start with things in the
100k&ohm; range. For mA loads, I'd start with 1-10k&ohm;. If you need
more than a few mA, then you really need a voltage regulator, not
a voltage divider.
