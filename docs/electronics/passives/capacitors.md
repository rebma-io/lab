# Capacitors

INFO: **Why We Call Them Passives** All components in electronics are
grouped into 2 categories (basically): active and passive. Passive
components don’t need an external power source to function. These
components use some other property to control the electrical signal. As
a result, they only require the current traveling through the connected
circuit.

## Representing Values
### Large Devices

### SMD

Smaller capacitors, such as ceramic types, often use a
shorthand-notation consisting of three digits and an optional letter,
where the digits (XYZ) denote the capacitance in picofarad (pF),
calculated as XY × 10Z, and the letter indicating the tolerance. Common
tolerances are ±5%, ±10%, and ±20%, denotes as J, K, and M,
respectively.
