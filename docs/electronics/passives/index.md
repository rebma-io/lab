# Passive Components

Active Components
: These components are parts of a circuit that rely on an external power
source to control or modify electrical signals. Active components such
as transistors and silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs) use electricity
to control electricity.

Passive Components

: Components like resistors, transformers, and diodes donâ€™t need an
external power source to function. These components use some other
property to control the electrical signal. They only require the current
traveling through the connected circuit. For example, resistors impede
the flow of electrons without introducing more electricity into the
system.
