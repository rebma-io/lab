# Passive Components

All components in electronics are grouped into 2 categories (basically):
active and passive. Passive components donâ€™t need an external power
source to function. These components use some other property to control
the electrical signal. As a result, they only require the current
traveling through the connected circuit. Resistors impede the flow of
electrons without introducing more electricity into the system.

## Inductors

An inductor can also be known as a coil, choke, or reactor.  It is a
two-terminal component that stores energy in a magnetic field when
current is flowing through it. A standard inductor normally consists of
an insulated (often varnished) wire that has been wrapped into a coil
situated around a core. When the voltage ratio (to current) changes the
inductor will oppose any changes in current through it.  When the power
is removed, the magnetic field will collapse, inducing a current in the
winding wire. A transformer is a form of compound inductor.
