## Parts

These are in alphabetic order and do not represent any preference on my part.

### ICs, Passives, Etc.

* [All Electronics](https://www.allelectronics.com). Retail and mail order store
  in Van Nuys, CA. Pricing is very good, but product selection can often be very spotty.
* [Arrow](https://www.arrow.com). One of the largest US electronics parts
  distributors (along with Digikey, Mouser, Newark, and a few others).
* [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com). My personal preference for shopping for
  parts. They have good tools (although all the big vendors do), provide
  excellent support, and I've never had a single mistake in an order.
* [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com). Related to JLC PCB, a huge distributor in China.
  Sometimes have great volumes and cheap prices, but also carry a lot of random
  parts made by Chinese companies that are not really distributed through the
  global supply chain otherwise.
* [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com). Another of the big distributors.
* [Newark](https://www.newark.com). Another of the big distributors.
* [Octopart](https://octopart.com). A great search engine for looking at
  availability of parts across a bunch of suppliers.
* [Powell Electronics](https://powell.com). Specialist in connectors and
  switches.


### Others

* [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com). A maker bazaar with a lot of neat products
  directly from individuals.
* [Redco Audio](https://www.redco.com). Audio cables, connectors, project
  boxes, etc. 

### Catch All Everythin

* [AliExpress](https://aliexpress.us). You can find just about anything here,
  but the quality of the products can be very variable. If you're looking for
  some bizarre random IC, though, it might be your best choice. Shipping is
  typically measured in weeks to months.
* [Amazon](https://amazon.com). I mean, it's Amazon. It's probably on there, and
  often appears to be being sold by the same people as on AliExpress. Quite
  honestly, the pricing isn't that great, and the only real advantage it offers
  is typically fast shipping.
