# The Lab

NOTE: This site is very early and there's very little here yet. Most of this
needs to be moved from other recording systems first.

The overall goal of this is to provide as much research, thoughts, plans, and
overall discovered detritus as possible to (hopefully) help someone else
complete a project. It is organized into a few top-level sections, from
left to right:

* About
* Resources
* 3D
* Electronics
* Mechanical
* Organization
* Projects
* Tools
