# The Lab

NOTE: If you have a request, please open a [Github
Issue](https://github.com/rebma-io/lab/issues), and I'll see what I can
do. I try to limit my discussion to things I am somewhat confident
about. 

The overall goal of this is to provide as much research, thoughts, plans, and
overall discovered detritus as possible to (hopefully) help someone else
complete a project. It is organized into a few top-level sections, from
left to right:

* About
* Resources
* 3D
* Electronics
* Mechanical
* Organization
* Projects
* Tools

I also think it's worth talking about what it means to be a maker,
though. I think Adam Savage summed it up best in the video below (it's
the first 10 minutes, and the rest is open Q&A), but it comes down to
his 10 commandments of the maker:

1. Make something.
2. Make something useful.
3. Start right now.
4. Find a project.
5. Ask for help, advice, and feedback.
6. Share.
7. Recognize that discouragement and failure is part of the project.
8. Measure carefully.
9. Make things for other people.
10. Use more cooling fluid.
