# The Lab

NOTE: If you have a request, please open a [Github
Issue](https://github.com/rebma-io/lab/issues), and I'll see what I can
do. I try to limit my discussion to things I am somewhat confident
about. 

The overall goal of this is to provide as much research, thoughts, plans, and
overall discovered detritus as possible to (hopefully) help someone else
complete a project. It is organized into a few top-level sections, from
left to right:

* Projects. As I find time, there will be documentation of various
  projects here. They could be hardware, software, or both.
* Electronics. Resources about electronics. Starting with fundamentals
  and working up through more advanced stuff.
* Mechanical. What it means to make something in the real world, stick
  it together, and make it move (or not move) as you see fit.
* 3D Stuff. My work in 3D printing, though mostly just small things to
  make life easier.
* Software. References for writing software, both general, and more
  specifically for Python.
* Organization. How to keep a workshop organized. I'm not great at this,
  but I've developed a few patterns.
* Tools. Mostly hand tools.
* Resources. Other places to find things.
* Tags. I'm trying to get better at tagging resources, so you can find
  an "index" of sorts here.
* About. A bit about me.

I also think it's worth talking about what it means to be a maker,
though. I [think Adam Savage summed it up
best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER7rhQ7N69k), but it comes down to
his 10 commandments of the maker:

1. Make something.
2. Make something useful.
3. Start right now.
4. Find a project.
5. Ask for help, advice, and feedback.
6. Share.
7. Recognize that discouragement and failure is part of the project.
8. Measure carefully.
9. Make things for other people.
10. Use more cooling fluid.
