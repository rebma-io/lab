# Product Breakdown Structure

CONSTRUCTION: **Huge Work in Progress** This is just a quick intro to
what a PBS is, but not _why_ you might want one, or how to implement
one. I hope to dig into that in the future, but for now, I think it's
better to at least plant the seed in your head.

A [product breakdown
structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_breakdown_structure) (PBS) is
just a way to decompose a product into all of its constituent parts. For example
(taken from Wikipedia):

This is all it is. There are a lot of ways to organize this, and I'll talk more
about how I integrate a parts numbering scheme to a PBS, but it can best be
thought of as a way to break down your project into manageable and consumable
pieces that you can tackle. You only need to decompose it as much as makes
sense, although in some cases it will be broken down all the way to a single screw.
