## Large Storage Organization

### IKEA ALEX

I'm a pretty big fan of the IKEA
[ALEX](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/alex-series-47147/) series of storage. I
have several of the [9 drawer
units](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/alex-drawer-unit-with-9-drawers-white-90486139/)
and one of the [5 drawer
units](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/alex-drawer-unit-white-00473546/). They go
together pretty quickly, and are mildly durable.

## Small Parts Storage

### Plano ProLatch

I'm a pretty big fan of Plano's ProLatch series of storage. They're designed for
fishing lures, but are well made, the lid seals pretty tight to the top of the
dividers (reducing risk of parts moving around), and best of all, inexpensive.
And they're even made in the United States. I use the following models for
various purposes:

* [3500](https://www.planooutdoors.com/prolatch-3500-stowaway-1592729). 9.13" x
  5" x 1.25"
* [3600](https://www.planooutdoors.com/prolatch-3600-stowaway-1592734). 11" x
  7.25" x 1.75"
* [3700](https://www.planooutdoors.com/prolatch-3700-stowaway-1592742). 13" x 9"
  x 2"
* [3780](https://www.planooutdoors.com/prolatch-3700-deep-bulk-stowaway-1592738).
  14" x 9.13" x 2.8"

For each box, I put 2 large labels (see [Labeling](labeling.md)) on it with a
top-level description of what is in the box (e.g., "M3/M4/M5/M6 SS Hex Screws" for
stainless-steel M3-M6 screws). One goes on the long edge (with the latches), and
the other on the short edge for better discovery when shelved.

In addition, I use 3x5 index cards to describe the organization within the box's
many compartments. These are just handwritten and then places in a small holder
on the front ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BJQ7TM4F/)), which
lets me read it and update it as necessary. You can see an example here:

### AideTek

For small surface mount parts, I'm a big fan of the
[Aidetek](https://aidetek.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=A&Product_Code=BOXALL)
144 compartment SMD storage enclosure, shown below:

They also make nice ESD-safe boxes for a little more money that are perfect for
SMD ICs and other semiconductors that are more sensitive to ESD.
