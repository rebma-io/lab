## Large Storage Organization

### IKEA ALEX

I'm a pretty big fan of the IKEA
[ALEX](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/alex-series-47147/) series of storage. I
have several of the [9 drawer
units](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/alex-drawer-unit-with-9-drawers-white-90486139/)
and one of the [5 drawer
units](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/alex-drawer-unit-white-00473546/). They go
together pretty quickly, and are mildly durable.

## Small Parts Storage

One of the things you'll accumulate a huge number of is small parts.
Whether it's a screw, an IC, or a bunch of tiny SMD resistors, you need
to figure out a way to keep them organized. For a lot of people, this
means drawer systems, but due to the arrangement and design of my work
area, these are not feasible for me.

### Plano ProLatch

I'm a pretty big fan of Plano's ProLatch series of storage. They're designed for
fishing lures, but are well made, the lid seals pretty tight to the top of the
dividers (reducing risk of parts moving around), and best of all, inexpensive.
And they're even made in the United States. I use the following models for
various purposes:

* [3500](https://www.planooutdoors.com/prolatch-3500-stowaway-1592729). 9.13" x
  5" x 1.25"
* [3600](https://www.planooutdoors.com/prolatch-3600-stowaway-1592734). 11" x
  7.25" x 1.75"
* [3700](https://www.planooutdoors.com/prolatch-3700-stowaway-1592742). 13" x 9"
  x 2"
* [3780](https://www.planooutdoors.com/prolatch-3700-deep-bulk-stowaway-1592738).
  14" x 9.13" x 2.8"

For each box, I put 2 large labels (see [Labeling](labeling.md)) on it with a
top-level description of what is in the box (e.g., "M3/M4/M5/M6 SS Hex Screws" for
stainless-steel M3-M6 screws). One goes on the long edge (with the latches), and
the other on the short edge for better discovery when shelved.

In addition, I use 3x5 index cards to describe the organization within the box's
many compartments. These are just handwritten and then places in a small holder
on the front ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BJQ7TM4F/)), which
lets me read it and update it as necessary. You can see an example here:

### AideTek

For small surface mount parts, I'm a big fan of the
[Aidetek](https://aidetek.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=A&Product_Code=BOXALL)
144 compartment SMD storage enclosure, shown below:

[![Aidetek 144 compartment
box](/img/aidetek-boxall-144.jpg)](https://aidetek.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=A&Product_Code=BOXALL)

They also make nice ESD-safe boxes for a little more money that are
perfect for things that need a little extra protection, such as ICs and
transistors.

## Liquid Storage

There are two different ways I like to store liquids, depending on how
they'll be used. The first is to use [wash
bottles](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07Z8ZN9Z3/) made out of LDPE
for things that get used in more of a "squirt here and there", like
wetting a sponge, or rinsing something. For everything else, I keep it
in either 1oz (28ml) or 2oz (56ml) [clear boston round
bottles](https://www.specialtybottle.com/glass-bottles/clear-boston-rounds)
with integrated eyedroppers.
