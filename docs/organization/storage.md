# Storage

## Large Storage Organization

### IKEA ALEX

I'm a pretty big fan of the IKEA
[ALEX](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/alex-series-47147/) series of storage. I
have several of the [9 drawer
units](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/alex-drawer-unit-with-9-drawers-white-90486139/)
and one of the [5 drawer
units](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/alex-drawer-unit-white-00473546/). They go
together pretty quickly, and are mildly durable.

### Government Surplus Bookcases

## Small Parts Storage

### Plano ProLatch

I'm a pretty big fan of Plano's ProLatch series of storage. They're designed for
fishing lures, but are well made, the lid seals pretty tight to the top of the
dividers (reducing risk of parts moving around), and best of all, inexpensive.
And they're even made in the United States. I use the following models for
various purposes:

* [3500](https://www.planooutdoors.com/prolatch-3500-stowaway-1592729). 9.13" x
  5" x 1.25"
* [3600](https://www.planooutdoors.com/prolatch-3600-stowaway-1592734). 11" x
  7.25" x 1.75"
* [3700](https://www.planooutdoors.com/prolatch-3700-stowaway-1592742). 13" x 9"
  x 2"
* [3780](https://www.planooutdoors.com/prolatch-3700-deep-bulk-stowaway-1592738).
  14" x 9.13" x 2.8"
