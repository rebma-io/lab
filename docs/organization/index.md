# Organization

In here, I discuss [how I manage inventory](inventory.md) including [part
numbers](part-numbers.md), [labeling](labeling.md), [note
taking](note-taking.md), [storage of parts and pieces](storage.md), and also how
to approach a [product breakdown structure](product-breakdown-structure.md) to
help figure out what you need to work on.

## Tooling

Proper organization requires tools, and while I'm sure you could use an
old-fashioned account record book to keep track of everything, I strongly
recommend finding a computer-augmented system. For me, I have used a combination
of a few tools:

* [Microsoft OneNote](https://onenote.com). This contains a lot of my working
  project information, queue of things to read, and some general reference
  information that's likely of no use to anyone else.
* [Paper](note-taking.md). This is where I keep my stream of thoughts,
  observations, tests, experiments, and notes from any other sources that I
  consume.
* [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/oT8AoW6e). This is where I keep
  inventory, parts, lists of filament specs, etc. I think of it as a more souped
  up Microsoft Excel, and while it's missing a lot of the power of Excel, it
  makes up for it in flexibility and being web-only (there are desktop apps, but
  they're just really Electron). I've had too many issues with synchronization
  of Excel files between multiple computers if one happens to have them open at
  the same time. It is a commercial product, but the free version is good enough
  to figure out if it's something you'll benefit from.
