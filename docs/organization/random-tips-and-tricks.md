# Random Tips and Tricks

These are often not my idea, but I try to identify where they came from.
It's just a collection of things I've grabbed from around the swirling
universe.

## Custom Boxes for Organization

From [this update on Circuit
Python](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/2023/09/11/python-on-microcontrollers-newsletter-new-versions-of-circuitpython-and-pimoroni-micropython-and-more-circuitpython-python-micropython-thepsf-raspberry_pi/),
comes a neat trick from
[Scott](https://blog.adafruit.com/author/scott/):

> After seeing creative drawer inserts for the Ikea Kallax bookshelf, I
> realized I could get custom cardboard boxes to fit in each square. I
> found a custom box place with low minimum quantities and now have just
> over 20 boxes for around $40. 10 of the shallowest boxes can fit in a
> single square. A wood 10 drawer set is $140. Iâ€™ll be moving over to
> the boxes as I use dev boards (and dig them out of my packing.)

Not sure where he sourced the boxes from though. Just [don't use
ULine](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/19/republican-megadonor-uihlein-470268).
Ever.
