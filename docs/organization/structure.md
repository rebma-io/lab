# Organization Structure

How you organize things isn't as critical as just having a system. This
is some of my (in progress) system. Some of it is quite formalized, and
some of it is just ad hoc.

* [Inventory](inventory.md).
* [Part Numbers](part-numbers.md).
* [Product Breakdown Structure (PBS)](product-breakdown-structure.md).
