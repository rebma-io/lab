# Blogs and Websites


## Websites

* [NASA Workmanship Pictorial
  Reference](https://nepp.nasa.gov/index.cfm/5575). If you've ever
  wondered what the _correct_ way is to join two wires together, or
  wondered how to deal with PCB design, this is the thing for you. NASA
  is, realistically, at the very tippy top of the game when it comes to
  quality, so this pictorial reference is an enormous resource.
  
## Blogs

Alas, blogs are a dying breed, or at least feel like it. Mine is included in
that. Here's a few that I find super helpful:

* [lcamtuf](https://lcamtuf.substack.com). Primarily electronics, but with
  excellent explanations and discussion that is very approachable.
* [Altium Resources](https://resources.altium.com/).
* [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog). Like Altium,
  this s for a specific product, but much of the information is useful for a
  wide range of applications.
* [Sierra Circuits](https://www.protoexpress.com/blog/). Guidance and wisdom
  from one of the top PCB manufacturers in the world. They also have a huge
  number of resources that I'll discuss elsewhere.
* [Dangerous Prototypes](http://dangerousprototypes.com/blog/).
* [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/)
* [bunnie's blog](https://www.bunniestudios.com/)
* [Ken Shirriff](https://www.righto.com/). Deep, and I mean _very deep_ dives
  into computer history, IC reverse engineering, and such.
