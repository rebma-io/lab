## Blogs

Alas, blogs are a dying breed, or at least feel like it. Mine is included in
that. Here's a few that I find super helpful:

* [lcamtuf](https://lcamtuf.substack.com). Primarily electronics, but with
  excellent explanations and discussion that is very approachable.
* [Altium Resources](https://resources.altium.com/).
* [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog). Like Altium,
  this s for a specific product, but much of the information is useful for a
  wide range of applications.
* [Sierra Circuits](https://www.protoexpress.com/blog/). Guidance and wisdom
  from one of the top PCB manufacturers in the world. They also have a huge
  number of resources that I'll discuss elsewhere.
* [Dangerous Prototypes](http://dangerousprototypes.com/blog/).
* [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/)
* [bunnie's blog](https://www.bunniestudios.com/)
* [Ken Shirriff](https://www.righto.com/). Deep, and I mean _very deep_ dives
  into computer history, IC reverse engineering, and such.
