# Books

NOTE: **Support Your Library** If you have a local library, and I
suspect you do, it is entirely likely they will have copies of many of
these books. If your library participates in _O'Reilly for Public
Libraries_ (formerly Safari Books Online) they are also likely to have
these available electronically for free use. Reach out to your local
public or academic library to ask! Libraries love questions.

To me, books are still one of the best ways to learn. It provides a
curated and structured approach. Below are some of the books that I have
found useful and of high quality.

* [Art of Electronics (3rd
  edition)](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-art-of-electronics-paul-horowitz/9136306?ean=9780521809269).
  If applied electrical engineering has a bible, this is it. It's written in a
  very approachable style, and from a practical "this is what you actually need
  to know" perspective. While it does dig into much of the math and physics,
  it's also clear where you can ignore that if you're uninterested.
* [ARRL Handbook](https://www.arrl.org/arrl-handbook-2023). The Amateur Radio
  Relay League (ARRL) has been putting this book out for _100 years_. While it's
  done from the perspective of amateur (ham) radio, and definitely deals with a
  lot of radio-specific details, it also has a lot of practical information.
  Also, in this day and age of gigahertz microcontrollers, nearly everything can
  be a radio signal if you're squinting just right.
* [Encyclopedia of Electronic
  Circuits](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?st=sr&ac=qr&mode=basic&author=&title=encyclopedia+of+electronic+circuits&isbn=&lang=en&destination=us&currency=USD&binding=*&keywords=&publisher=&min_year=&max_year=&minprice=&maxprice=&classic=off).
  First released in 1985, this book is literally an encyclopedia of circuits.
  Nearly everything you can imagine is already there, and reading through it and
  thinking about "how does this work?" is a great way to learn from functioning
  circuits. It's not "baby's first book", but it's a heck of a useful reference
  to have. There are, I believe, 7 volumes (I have 4 of them).
* [Machinery's
  Handbook](https://bookshop.org/p/books/machinery-s-handbook-toolbox-erik-oberg/14131340?ean=9780831137311).
  In print for about 110 years, and now on its 31st edition, this is the bible
  of machining and machinery. If you want to understand materials and mechanical
  construction, though, it is indispensible. Clocking in at 3,000+ pages, it is
  an absolute beast of a book. Get the "large print" version, as it's more
  normal sized. The other is designed to be kept in a machinist's tool chest and
  is in tiny print.
* [Big Book of Maker
  Skills](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-big-book-of-maker-skills-tools-techniques-for-building-great-tech-projects-chris-hackett/11504243?ean=9781681884325).
  A breezy collection of a very diverse sets of skills that, as a maker, you'll
  likely need to know. It's the opposite of things like _Machinery's Handbook_
  in that it is enormously simplified and a cursory surface discussion of things
  like sanding, drilling, casting, refining, chiseling, and many dozens of other
  tools and skills.
* [Open Circuits: The Inner Beauty of Electronic
  Components](https://www.opencircuitsbook.com/). This is the equivalent of a
  centerfold or coffee-table book for electronic components. Through diligent
  work and stunning photography, they explore the beauty within the components.
