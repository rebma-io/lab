# Structured Education

NOTE: **Free as in Beer** Everything on this page is zero cost. There
are plenty of commercial offerings that are great, but as I've not
personally experienced many of them, I don't feel comfortable making any
recommendations. 

Not everyone can go to college, even community college, but structured
learning is available to everyone through a bunch of avenues. A few of
the ones that I strongly advocate are:

* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). Great for getting your
  math and science skills back up to where they (maybe) were.
* [MIT Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/). Lecture notes, videos,
  and even exams from MIT. For example, [EC.S06 - Practical
  Electronics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/ec-s06-practical-electronics-fall-2004/pages/calendar/)
  might be an interesting course to take. Or maybe [6.071J -
  Introduction to Electronics, Signals, and
  Measurement](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-071j-introduction-to-electronics-signals-and-measurement-spring-2006/pages/syllabus/). 
* [Analog Devices' Engineering University
  Program](https://wiki.analog.com/university). A very extensive online
  set of courses with lab exercises. This has a very deep analog
  component given the company's long history.
* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org). Coursera is a powerhouse in
  online learning, partnering with a bunch of educational institutions.
  You can take a look at their [electronics
  courses](https://www.coursera.org/search?query=electronics)
* [TU Delft Open Coursware](https://ocw.tudelft.nl/). Open educational
  resources from one of the finest engineering schools in Europe. I
  believe all of them are in English.
* [Video
  Calculus](https://online.math.uh.edu/HoustonACT/videocalculus/index.html).
  A 55 episode lecture series for learning calculus from start to mostly
  finish. Each episode is about 10-20m long.
