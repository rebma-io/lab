# Video

For better or worse, a lot of educational media has migrated from blogs
to video, especially YouTube. This can be super low-density, but it can
also be better. It simply depends on the creator. These are the
Maker-oriented YouTube channels that I follow (and why):

* [Adafruit](https://www.youtube.com/@adafruit)
* [bigclivedotcom](https://www.youtube.com/@bigclivedotcom)
* [CNC Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/@CNCKitchen)
* [EEVblog](https://www.youtube.com/@EEVblog)
* [ElectroBOOM](https://www.youtube.com/@ElectroBOOM)
* [element14 Presents](https://www.youtube.com/@element14presents)
* [engineerguy](https://www.youtube.com/@engineerguyvideo). Bill Hammack is the
  Carl Sagan of engineering. I think that explains him best. His new book, _The
  Things We Make_ is an excellent introduction to the engineering mindset.
* [IMSAIGuy](https://www.youtube.com/@IMSAIGuy)
* [Machining and Microwaves](https://www.youtube.com/@MachiningandMicrowaves).
  If you're interested in all sorts of experimental microwave and custom
  machined parts.
* [Maker's Muse](https://www.youtube.com/@MakersMuse)
* [Naomi Wu](https://www.youtube.com/@Naomi-Wu). The ever present Real Sexy
  Cyborg is a very talented maker out of China who brings her very unique
  perspective to everything.
* [Phil's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilsLab). 
* [Practical Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/@PracticalEngineeringChannel).
  Grady mostly focuses on civil engineering, but the discussions are very
  helpful and informative.
* [Robert Feranec](https://www.youtube.com/@RobertFeranec)
* [Simone Giertz](https://www.youtube.com/@simonegiertz)
* [Sparkfun](https://www.youtube.com/@sparkfun)
* [Teaching Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@TeachingTech)
* [Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections)
* [Texas Instruments](https://www.youtube.com/@TexasInstruments)
* [w2aew](https://www.youtube.com/@w2aew)

There's also a few that are largely stagnant but still contain some good
content:

* [Afrotechmods](https://www.youtube.com/@Afrotechmods)
* [jdflyback](https://www.youtube.com/@jdflyback). Fun with vacuum tubes.
