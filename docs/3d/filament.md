# Filament

## Filament Brands

I've had good luck with a decent number of filaments that I can recommend
without reservation:

* [Prusament PLA/PETG](https://prusament.com/). Pricey, but excellent quality.
* [Jessie PLA](https://www.printedsolid.com/collections/1-75mm-jessie). I've only
  used the PLA, but the quality is outstanding and the price is excellent..
* [Polymaker](https://us.polymaker.com/). I've mostly used the PolyLite PLA Pro
  and PolyTerra PLA. I do love (!) their [material comparison
  site](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOGIxOTRjM2EtMGVhYS00ZDEwLWJmNTktYTlkYzRlOWY2Nzk2IiwidCI6IjUzOTgwYzA1LWI4MWYtNDM2My04OWNiLTU3NzRiMWFlYWYyZCIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D),
  and more manufacturers should do this. Their silks are lovely, and [starlight
  mercury](https://us.polymaker.com/products/polylite-starlight-pla) is pretty
  much hands-down favorite color.
* [Elegoo](https://www.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-pla-filament-1-75mm-3d-printer-filament-1kg-spool-2-2-lbs).
  Boring PLA. But also reliable and very inexpensive. It's made up a lot of the
  bulk printing for things like black.
* [Hatchbox](https://www.hatchbox3d.com/). I've used their matte and transparent
  filaments.
* [Protopasta](https://www.proto-pasta.com/). My home for fun and bizarre
  filaments. I have some of their
  [conductive](https://www.proto-pasta.com/collections/all/feature_electrically-conductive)
  and their
  [metal-filled](https://www.proto-pasta.com/collections/all/contents_metal-powder).
  Their prices aren't the cheapest, but the quality is there.
* [Overture](https://overture3d.com/products/overturepla). Just a general
  low-price quality filament.
* [Sainsmart TPU](https://www.sainsmart.com/collections/tpu-filament). TPU is a
  flexible filament, and this has been a reasonably successful one for a
  Bowden-tube loving 3d printer.
* [eSun cleaning filament](https://www.esun3d.com/eclean-product/). I only use their cleaning filament, but it's top notch.

## Filament Drying and Storage

A lot of filaments are hygroscopic, meaning they'll absorb water over
time. This can lead to a lot of problems with printing, and you can
sometimes hear the crackle of the water boiling away in the heater.
Because of this, I take a two-pronged strategy:

* Storage of filament in a dry box.
* Usage of a heater when printing.

### Dry Box Design

For storage, I use some [60qt storage
box](https://www.irisusainc.com/collections/weathertight/products/60-quart-weathertight-multi-purpose-storage-box-clear-with-blue-buckles-3-pack).
They are a nice size, easy to maneuver, and have foam gaskets to help reduce air
infiltration. Inside of that I've 3d printed a pair of [75mm containers for
desiccant](https://www.printables.com/model/1367-malolos-silica-gel-desiccant-containers)
(print the funnel and plug trust me), and filled it with [color-changing silica
desiccant](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013L31PQ0). So far, this has managed to
keep the RH somewhere between 20-30%. I monitor the boxes with an inexpensive
[ThermoPro TP49](https://buythermopro.com/product/tp49/) temperature and
humidity monitor.


### Filament Heater

When printing, I move the filament into a [SunLu filament dryer
v2](https://www.sunlu.com/products/new-version-sunlu-filadryer-s2). I've had
some issues with it getting pulled towards the printer, and even tipping over,
but I've mostly resolved that by 1) feeding the filament from the bottom, not
the top (think toilet paper roll); 2) adding some [wheel
weights](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071WP8HGP/) to give it some more
heft.
