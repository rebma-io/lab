# My Designs

You can find my designs on either
[Printables](https://www.printables.com/@petrilli_757262/models), which
is my preferred platform for sharing, or sometimes I keep things on
[Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/petrilli/designs) up to date.
I need to be better about that!

A few things I've put up:

* [A caddy for watchmaker's
  loupes](https://www.printables.com/model/464723-watchmakers-loupe-caddy).
  This holds 4 different ones that often come together in 5, 10, 15, and
  20X magnifications.
* [Alphabetic dividers for vinyl
  collections](https://www.printables.com/model/468864-divider-for-organizing-a-vinyl-collection).
  These are designed to fit onto the ubiquitous IKEA KALLAX shelving
  that vinyl people like me love.
* [Shelf mount for an Edsyn
  Soldapullt](https://www.printables.com/model/496368-edsyn-soldapullt-hanger).
  This allows you to mount a solder extractor to a shelf at easy reach.
* [Label catcher for a Brother
  PT-750W](https://www.printables.com/model/512678-label-catcher-for-brother-pt-750w).
  Catch all the labels before they get away. I've used this, in
  combination with the "mail merge" functionality in Brother's software
  to print hundreds of labels at a time.
* [Interior shelf for a
  fridge](https://www.printables.com/model/512793-interior-shelf-for-crownful-4l-mini-fridge).
  This is designed to store solder paste and flux and hold it in place.
* [Holder for Wera hex
  drivers](https://www.printables.com/model/532043-ceiling-mount-for-wera-screwdrivers-15-8mm-hex).
  Because of how my lab is oriented in the attic, I don't have a huge
  amount of vertical space, but I do have a 55&deg; ceiling. So, I took
  that and mounted the screwdrivers to it. 
* [Small feet for the Lenovo Thinkstation P320
  Ultra](https://www.printables.com/model/599108-lenovo-thinkstation-p320-tiny-feet).
  This might fit other similar things, but the P320 is what I made these
  for. I suspect it'd fit any of the small/tiny form factors.
