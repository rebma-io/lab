# Consumables

One of the things that I don't think we talk enough about is all the
consumables that we use in a hobby project. While I've talked about
[solder](../electronics/soldering.md) elsewhere, there's a bunch of
others that you typically need to keep around. These are the ones I
continuously keep in stock, and my thoughts about why I chose what I
chose.

## Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA)

> WARNING: **Safe Handling** Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is a _reasonably_
> safe material to handle, but I would strongly recommend a few
> precautions. First, you should, if possible, obtain the MSDS for the
> product you purchase, but if not, you can use one [such as this from
> Sigma-Aldrich](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/sds/ALDRICH/W292907).
> Reading this will give you a good understanding of what some of the
> risks and safe handling procedures are. 
>
> The general advice I would give is:
>
> 1. If you are going to directly handle IPA, meaning it will touch your
>    skin, wear [gloves](#gloves). I know this is a hassle, but it is
>    better safe than regretful in an ER in the future. You can use your
>    own judgement when this is triggered, but _for me_ I will wear
>    gloves if I'm not using a swab, or at least a wipe between me and
>    the IPA.
> 2. Never, ever, ever get IPA above its boiling point (typ. 82C, 180F)
>    unless you absolutely know what you're doing. IPA vapors can cause
>    severe respiratory distress and long-term damage. They also can
>    introduce the IPA into the bloodstream, which can lead to it
>    metabolizing into your body as acetone. You don't want that.
> 3. Store in a well-sealed container, and keep any you're not actively
>    using in a dark cool place for ensure long-term stability.

Also called isopropanol, and often just referred to as IPA, isopropyl
alcohol is a very inexpensive solvent that is used heavily in both
hobbyist and commercial electronics and mechanical works. While
typically available in a 60-90% concentration, you can easily obtain
99-99.9% concentration, which is what I recommend for use in this case.
Reducing the amount of water also reduces the possibility of
water-induced corrosion. 

For general use, I will admit to just buying the [Amazon Basics
99%](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NFSFBXQ/), which is "good enough".

## Anti-static Cleaning Spray

One thing to be aware of, though, is when you're cleaning an
electrostatic workbench mat, is that IPA can reduce the efficacy of the
mat at dealing with ESD. To avoid degrading something that's not
particularly cheap, I use a specific cleaner for anything where "static
control" is an issue (this includes my wooden workbench top as well,
although it's unclear if that does anything useful other than waste more
expensive consumables): [ACL Staticide Mat & Table Top
Cleaner](https://www.aclstaticide.com/products/mat-table-top-cleaner). 

To use it, you spray the surface with the Staticide, and then _allow it
to sit 2-3 minutes_, and then wipe off (with a [lint-free
wipe](#lint-free-wipes) preferably).

## Paper Towels

I do keep a roll of paper towls (specifically [Viva "signature
cloth"](https://www2.v1.vivatowels.com/en-us/products/viva-signature-cloth-paper-towels))
around for general cleaning purposes, wiping down a bench, etc. It's
worth keeping them close at hand, and so I have them mounted under the
desk to the drawer module.

## Lint-Free Wipes

You'll need to wipe things _a lot_ when working with electronics and 3D
printing, so it's good to keep a heavy stock of lint-free wipes. You
want [non-woven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonwoven_fabric) wipes in
a blend of polyester and cellulose. Personally, I keep a stock of [4x4"
AAWipes](https://www.aawipes.com/products/aawipes-bag-of-600-pcs-4-x-4-cleanroom-wipes-delicate-task-wipers),
which are common in cleanroom applications. You can buy smaller volumes
on their [Amazon store](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YF88GJH/).
Sadly, they are typically single-use, although I have been known to
reuse one if I've just used it to wipe a reasonably clean surface with
IPA and need to do it again.

WARNING: **Disinfecting Wipes** Don't confuse these for disinfecting
wipes like what you would use in the kitchen.  Those have chemicals in
them that can damage sensitive electronics and often will leave a
residue behind.

## Low Lint Swabs

Often, you'll need to get into the crevices of something, or between
leads on an IC, to clean them, and to do that using a [low lint cotton
swab](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/low-lint-swabs/). The relative
of the random cotton swab at your local pharmacy, they're a tiny bit
more expensive, but have wooden handles, and cotton woven in a way that
leaves a minimal amount of lint behind.

They're also available in an ESD-safe version, but it's about 10-15x
more expensive, and while I _know_ I should probably use them, I'm
simply too cheap to buy them. The ESD-safe ones use a plastic handle and
a polyurethane foam tip. If you're wanting to splurge, please do.

## Gloves

Gloves are disposable, much to the surprise of many people. They are
also relatively inexpensive.  While there are a few materials on the
market, I am a big fan of
[nitrile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrile) gloves as they
(typically) will not trigger latex allergies, which are more present
than you'd imagine, and no reason to tempt fate. In addition, I would
use something that is _at least_ 5 mils (0.005") thick (typically
measured at the palm). Personally, I like them in purple, but they come
in a bunch of different colors. 

The gloves I use are from
[Kimberly-Clark](https://www.kcprofessional.com/en-us/products/scientific-and-research/lab-environment/hand-protection-and-gloves/kimberly-clark-nitrile-gloves/55090)

If you're just touching things with your fingertips, you can also
consider using [finger cots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_cot),
which cover just the last joint of your fingers in most cases. They also
come in nitrile, and are pretty common in the electronics industry.
Personally, they drive me crazy, and I'd rather go through the time of
putting on one or two gloves.
