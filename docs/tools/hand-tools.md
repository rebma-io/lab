# Hand Tools

## General Guidance

My general guidance is that you should buy an inexpensive/cheap tool to start,
and upgrade once you've figured out 1) whether you would use it enough; 2) what
you value in the tool. Yes, there is often huge differences between cheap and
expensive tools, but it may not matter for your purposes. I call this the Harbor
Freight Rule. You don't buy a $700 Snap On bearing puller to do it once.

What I've included in here are the tools that I _personally_ like. Some are
super cheap, and some aren't.
