# Hand Tools

## General Guidance

My general guidance is that you should buy an inexpensive/cheap tool to start,
and upgrade once you've figured out 1) whether you would use it enough; 2) what
you value in the tool. Yes, there is often huge differences between cheap and
expensive tools, but it may not matter for your purposes. I call this the Harbor
Freight Rule. You don't buy a $700 Snap On bearing puller to do it once.

What I've included in here are the tools that I _personally_ like. Some are
super cheap, and some aren't.

## Soldering

### Soldering Iron/Station

My soldering iron of choice is a (10 year old?) Hakko FX-888 (analog). A while
back they converted to the [FX-888D digital
version](https://hakkousa.com/fx-888d), and I'm sure it's equally good. Hakko is
one of the big makers of soldering equipment, and their equipment is very well
regarded. I like the FX-888 because it's small, and heats up quickly.

I have a few recommendations, though, if you're considering buying a soldering
iron/station:

1. You absolutely, positively must have accurate temperature control. Super
   cheap irons just don't have that control which can lead to poor soldering,
   terrible user experience, and potentially damaged components.
2. Stick to one of the well known manufacturers. There's a lot of
   random-string-of-letters named companies on Amazon peddling knock offs, and
   some are probably fine, and a lot are not. When I say "well known", I'd list
   Hakko, Weller, JBC, Metcal, or Edsyn. Not only are they better made, but they
   (and the entire ecosystem) will be supported for decades. I can easily buy
   T18 tips for my Hakko from dozens of places.
3. Soldering stations (meant to be in a single location) tend to be better bang
   for buck than a soldering pen (like the well regarded
   [TS-80P](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4244)). All that additional
   complexity cost money. Unless you need to be able to throw it in your
   backpack, it's not really the best trade off.
4. Don't overspend. Yes, get a decent brand, but you don't need a $3,000 JBC
   workstation.

NOTE: You might not need a soldering iron. There are a lot of ecosystems, like
[STEMMA
QT](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt),
which don't require soldering to connect things together.

### Desoldering Tool and Solder Wick

It doesn't matter how good you get, you'll always make mistakes. It just
happens. Being able to clean up and correct them is critical, and there's two
things you can use to remove solder:

* "Solder suckers". These are spring-loaded little tubes that will suck the
  solder off the PCB or wire. They have big brothers that use vacuum pumps to do
  the same thing, but those are _very_ expensive.
* Solder wick. This is basically super-fine copper braided together and then
  with a coating of flux and other materials to help remove solder.

Which one should you get? I would get one of each. Solder wick is cheap, but
it's single use and a consumable. For a solder sucker, I absolutely swear by the
original Edsyn [Soldapullt](https://www.edsyn.com/product/DHT/DS017.html) (I
actually have the [Silverstat](https://www.edsyn.com/product/AS196.html) model I
got on clearance from [TEquipment](https://www.tequipment.net/)). 

For solder wick, like solder and flux, I would recommend sticking with one of
the big names: Multicore, MG Chemicals, or Chip Quik. My luck with cheap little
ones I've gotten off AliExpress and elsewhere is... disappointing. 

WARNING: Be careful when using solder wick. You are holding copper braid, and
copper loves nothing so much as to transfer heat ... quickly.
