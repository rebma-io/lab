# 3D Printed Tools

Unlike many people, I don't think that FFF 3D printing is a
great technology for making tools. There's a good reason that they have
historically been primarily made from metals. Having said that, there's
a huge number of things you can print yourself that will enhance your
experience in a home workshop or lab.

## Sorting Containers

There are two models from [@Area51](https://www.printables.com/@Area51)
that I have found insanely useful. The first is [these sorting
trays](https://www.printables.com/model/114308-sorting-tray-with-funnel)
that you can 3D print using a minimum of filament. They come in a _ton_
of sizes (50, 75, 100, 125, 150, adn 175mm square). They have a very
useful funnel attached, and most importantly they stack! I print them
with my [fast profile](../3D/prusa.md#makers-muse-slicer-settings) and
they are super solid. They're fine in PLA as well as PETG.

In addition, @Area51 has provided
[dividers](https://www.printables.com/model/131075-dividers-for-sorting-tray-with-funnel)
for the sorting trays. This is great when you need to divide a larger
tray or want to block them from leaving via the funnel.

I use these _extensively_ when sorting through parts, or even when I am
assembling/disassembling something to collect screws and other small
parts. 

FUTURE: **Improvement Opportunity** I've thought about maybe adding some
magnets to the bottom of them to help hold ferrous screws/bolts better.
While I have some metal sorting containers, these are wildly better
sized and the funnel should never be underestimated.
