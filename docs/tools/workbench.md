Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is one of the things that can damage
electronics, often invisibly. While you don't need to go to the lengths
that are used in production settings, it's worth taking a couple steps
to reduce any risks. I discuss ESD more [in this section on protecting
circuits](../electronics/protecting-circuits.md).
