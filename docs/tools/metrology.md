# Basics of Metrology

WARNING: **Super High Level** This document is very high-level, and is
based on my primitive and basic understanding of amazingly advanced and
complicated topics. I've tried to impart a few things that I've learned
that have helped me over the years.

This is probably better termed "how to not suck at measuring things",
rather than the basics of metrology. Metrology is a crazy topic full of
rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. Wikipedia [defines
metrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrology) as:

> Metrology is the scientific study of measurement. It establishes a
> common understanding of units, crucial in linking human activities.
> [...] Metrology is divided into three basic overlapping activities:
>
> * The definition of units of measurement
> * The realization of these units of measurement in practice
> * Traceability—linking measurements made in practice to the reference standards
> 
> These overlapping activities are used in varying degrees by the three
> basic sub-fields of metrology:
> 
> * Scientific or fundamental metrology, concerned with the
>   establishment of units of measurement.
> * Applied, technical or industrial metrology—the application of
>   measurement to manufacturing and other processes in society. 
> * Legal metrology, covering the regulation and statutory requirements
>   for measuring instruments and methods of measurement.
