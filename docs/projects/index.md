# Projects

This area contains various explorations of projects. Some of it is just a
collection of ideas, while others are things like Jupyter notebooks exploring
those ideas.

* [Signed GS1 data matrix barcodes](signed-GS1-data-matrix.ipynb). A Jupyter
  notebook exploring how you might integrate Ed25519 elliptic-curve cryptography
  into a data matrix formatted for the GS1 standard to ensure some kind of
  traceability. 
* [Adding Kelvin clips to a DE-5000 LCR meter](LCR-meter-Kelvin-clips/index.md).
  Step-by-step walk through of adding more appropriate Kelvin clips to
  my DE-5000 LCR meter.
* [Replacement microscope base](replacement-microscope-base/index.md).
  Replacing a light-weight non-magnetic aluminum base for my video
  microscope with a heavy powder-coated steel plate.
* [Cleaning up a set of telescoping
  gauges](decrunching-telescoping-gauges/index.md). I found some super
  cheap telescoping hole gauges at a yard sale. Can I make them
  passable? Find out!
* [HAUSRACK](https://hausrack.rebma.io). A ludicrously overcomplicated
  home automation contraption.
