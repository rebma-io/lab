# Projects

This area contains various explorations of projects. Some of it is just a
collection of ideas, while others are things like Jupyter notebooks exploring
those ideas.

* [Signed GS1 data matrix barcodes](signed-GS1-data-matrix.ipynb). A Jupyter
  notebook exploring how you might integrate Ed25519 elliptic-curve cryptography
  into a data matrix formatted for the GS1 standard to ensure some kind of
  traceability.
