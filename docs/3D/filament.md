# Filament

## Filament Brands

I've had good luck with a decent number of filaments that I can recommend
without reservation:

* [Prusament PLA/PETG](https://prusament.com/). Pricey, but excellent quality.
* [Jessie PLA](https://www.printedsolid.com/collections/1-75mm-jessie). I've only
  used the PLA, but the quality is outstanding and the price is excellent..
* [Polymaker](https://us.polymaker.com/). I've mostly used the PolyLite PLA Pro
  and PolyTerra PLA. I do love (!) their [material comparison
  site](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOGIxOTRjM2EtMGVhYS00ZDEwLWJmNTktYTlkYzRlOWY2Nzk2IiwidCI6IjUzOTgwYzA1LWI4MWYtNDM2My04OWNiLTU3NzRiMWFlYWYyZCIsImMiOjEwfQ%3D%3D),
  and more manufacturers should do this. Their silks are lovely, and [starlight
  mercury](https://us.polymaker.com/products/polylite-starlight-pla) is pretty
  much hands-down favorite color.
* [Elegoo](https://www.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-pla-filament-1-75mm-3d-printer-filament-1kg-spool-2-2-lbs).
  Boring PLA. But also reliable and very inexpensive. It's made up a lot of the
  bulk printing for things like black.
* [Hatchbox](https://www.hatchbox3d.com/). I've used their matte and transparent
  filaments.
* [Protopasta](https://www.proto-pasta.com/). My home for fun and bizarre
  filaments. I have some of their
  [conductive](https://www.proto-pasta.com/collections/all/feature_electrically-conductive)
  and their
  [metal-filled](https://www.proto-pasta.com/collections/all/contents_metal-powder).
  Their prices aren't the cheapest, but the quality is there.
* [Overture](https://overture3d.com/products/overturepla). Just a general
  low-price quality filament.
* [Sainsmart TPU](https://www.sainsmart.com/collections/tpu-filament). TPU is a
  flexible filament, and this has been a reasonably successful one for a
  Bowden-tube loving 3d printer.
* [eSun cleaning filament](https://www.esun3d.com/eclean-product/). I only use their cleaning filament, but it's top notch.

## Filament Drying and Storage

A lot of filaments are hygroscopic, meaning they'll absorb water over time. This
can lead to a lot of [problems]() with printing, and you can sometimes hear the
crackle of the water boiling away in the heater. Because of this, I take a two
pronged strategy:

* Storage of filament in a dry box.
* Usage of a heater when printing.

### Dry Box Design

[60qt storage box](https://www.irisusainc.com/collections/weathertight/products/60-quart-weathertight-multi-purpose-storage-box-clear-with-blue-buckles-3-pack)
nice size, easy to maneuver, foam gasket to help reduce air infiltration
[color-changing silica desiccant](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013L31PQ0)
[3D-printed container for desiccant](https://www.printables.com/model/1367-malolos-silica-gel-desiccant-containers)
print the plug and funnel, you'll thank me. 100mm
