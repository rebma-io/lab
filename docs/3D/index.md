# 3D Things

<!-- TODO:
* Discus places to find files, Printables, Thingaverse, Thangs, etc.

3D modeling and printing is an enormously versatile and powerful area,
but it's also a complicated one. I've tried to collect a few things
together that will hopefully be of some assistance. 

* [Filament](filament.md). Contains a discussion of filament brands and
  storage. 
* [Fusion 360](fusion360.md). Tips and tricks around the use of [Fusion
  360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription). 
* [Joining Parts Together](joining-parts.md). Not everything can be
  printed as a single piece, so how do you stick them together?
* [Modeling Tools](modeling-tools.md). Discussion of modeling tools
  besides Fusion 360.
* [Octoprint](octoprint.md). Octoprint lets you control a 3D printer
  over the network, and even from around the world.
* [Parametric Parameters](parametric-parameters.md). One of the most
  powerful parts of parametric modeling tools, like Fusion 360 or
  SOLIDWORKS, is the ability to drive everything based on adjustable
  parameters. 
* [Prusa 3D Printers](prusa.md). Tips and tricks around Prusa printers,
  specifically the MINI+.
* [3DEXPERIENCE SOLIDWORKS](solidworks.md). A few little details about
  SOLIDWORKS.
