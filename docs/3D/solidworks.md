## Useful Properties for Drawings

When building something dynamic, I found the following properties to be useful
when building 2D drawings:

* `CompanyName`
* `DrawnBy`/`DrawnDate`
* `CheckedBy`/`CheckedDate`
* `Revision`

SOLIDWORKS also brings in the following properties from each _part_ or
_assembly_:

* `Description` (as Title)
* `Weight`
* `Material`
* `Finish`
* `Revision`
