# Books and Media

## Books

* [Art of Electronics (3rd
  edition)](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-art-of-electronics-paul-horowitz/9136306?ean=9780521809269).
  If applied electrical engineering has a bible, this is it. It's written in a
  very approachable style, and from a practical "this is what you actually need
  to know" perspective. While it does dig into much of the math and physics,
  it's also clear where you can ignore that if you're uninterested.
* [ARRL Handbook](https://www.arrl.org/arrl-handbook-2023). The Amateur Radio
  Relay League (ARRL) has been putting this book out for _100 years_. While it's
  done from the perspective of amateur (ham) radio, and definitely deals with a
  lot of radio-specific details, it also has a lot of practical information.
  Also, in this day and age of gigahertz microcontrollers, nearly everything can
  be a radio signal if you're squinting just right.
* [Encyclopedia of Electronic
  Circuits](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?st=sr&ac=qr&mode=basic&author=&title=encyclopedia+of+electronic+circuits&isbn=&lang=en&destination=us&currency=USD&binding=*&keywords=&publisher=&min_year=&max_year=&minprice=&maxprice=&classic=off).
  First released in 1985, this book is literally an encyclopedia of circuits.
  Nearly everything you can imagine is already there, and reading through it and
  thinking about "how does this work?" is a great way to learn from functioning
  circuits. It's not "baby's first book", but it's a heck of a useful reference
  to have. There are, I believe, 7 volumes (I have 4 of them).
* [Machinery's
  Handbook](https://bookshop.org/p/books/machinery-s-handbook-toolbox-erik-oberg/14131340?ean=9780831137311)
* [Big Book of Maker Skills](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-big-book-of-maker-skills-tools-techniques-for-building-great-tech-projects-chris-hackett/11504243?ean=9781681884325)
* [Practical Doomsday: A User's Guide to the End of the
  World](https://bookshop.org/p/books/practical-doomsday-a-user-s-guide-to-the-end-of-the-world-michal-zalewski/17374960?ean=9781718502123)
* [Open Circuits: The Inner Beauty of Electronic
  Components](https://www.opencircuitsbook.com/). 


## YouTube Channels

For better or worse, a lot of educational media has migrated from blogs to
YouTube. This can be super low-density, but it can also be better. It simply
depends on the creator. These are the Maker-oriented YouTube channels that I
follow (and why):

* [Adafruit](https://www.youtube.com/@adafruit)
* [bigclivedotcom](https://www.youtube.com/@bigclivedotcom)
* [CNC Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/@CNCKitchen)
* [EEVblog](https://www.youtube.com/@EEVblog)
* [ElectroBOOM](https://www.youtube.com/@ElectroBOOM)
* [element14 Presents](https://www.youtube.com/@element14presents)
* [engineerguy](https://www.youtube.com/@engineerguyvideo). Bill Hammack is the
  Carl Sagan of engineering. I think that explains him best. His new book, _The
  Things We Make_ is an excellent introduction to the engineering mindset.
* [IMSAIGuy](https://www.youtube.com/@IMSAIGuy)
* [Machining and Microwaves](https://www.youtube.com/@MachiningandMicrowaves).
  If you're interested in all sorts of experimental microwave and custom
  machined parts.
* [Maker's Muse](https://www.youtube.com/@MakersMuse)
* [Naomi Wu](https://www.youtube.com/@Naomi-Wu). The ever present Real Sexy
  Cyborg is a very talented maker out of China who brings her very unique
  perspective to everything.
* [Phil's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilsLab). 
* [Practical Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/@PracticalEngineeringChannel).
  Grady mostly focuses on civil engineering, but the discussions are very
  helpful and informative.
* [Robert Feranec](https://www.youtube.com/@RobertFeranec)
* [Simone Giertz](https://www.youtube.com/@simonegiertz)
* [Sparkfun](https://www.youtube.com/@sparkfun)
* [Teaching Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@TeachingTech)
* [Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections)
* [Texas Instruments](https://www.youtube.com/@TexasInstruments)
* [w2aew](https://www.youtube.com/@w2aew)

There's also a few that are largely stagnant but still contain some good
content:

* [Afrotechmods](https://www.youtube.com/@Afrotechmods)
* [jdflyback](https://www.youtube.com/@jdflyback). Fun with vacuum tubes.

## Blogs

Alas, blogs are a dying breed, or at least feel like it. Mine is included in
that. Here's a few that I find super helpful:

* [lcamtuf](https://lcamtuf.substack.com). Primarily electronics, but with
  excellent explanations and discussion that is very approachable.
* [Altium Resources](https://resources.altium.com/).
* [Sierra Circuits](https://www.protoexpress.com/blog/).
* [Dangerous Prototypes](http://dangerousprototypes.com/blog/).
* [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/)
* [bunnie's blog](https://www.bunniestudios.com/)
* [Ken Shirriff](https://www.righto.com/). Deep, and I mean _very deep_ dives
  into computer history, IC reverse engineering, and such.
