# Suppliers

## Parts

* [Grainger](https://www.grainger.com/). Industrial supplies.
* [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/). Supplier of all-the-things
  mechanical and industrial.
* [OMC Steppers](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com). Gigantic selection of
  affordable and reasonably high quality steppers, servo motors, and other
  spinny things.
* [Pololu](https://www.pololu.com). A great source for all things robotics, from
  kits to parts.

## Materials

* [Online Metals](https://www.onlinemetals.com). East to buy of huge varieties
  of metals and plastics. Part of the larger thyssenkrupp AG.
* [Roto Metals](https://www.rotometals.com). A great source for weird eutectic
  alloys. 

## 3D Manufacturing Services

I've included a bunch of companies that do something _more_ than just FFF/FDM
manufacturing. These are techniques that are typically not available to anyone
at home.

* [eMachineShop](https://www.emachineshop.com/). Very capable machine shop that
  does CNC machining, laser and water cutting, turning, injection molding, and
  even 3D printing. The main issue I have is they seem only to want to deal with
  their own CAD software.
* [Hubs](https://www.hubs.com/). An entry to a peer-to-peer services network.
  Definitely access to a lot of interesting services. Part of
  [Protolabs](https://www.protolabs.com).
* [i.materialise](https://i.materialise.com/en). General 3D printing services.
* [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/). 3D printing, laser cutting, PCB assembly,
  photochemical metal etching (great for super thin fine parts).
* [Sculpteo](https://www.sculpteo.com/en/). 3D printing and laser cutting.
* [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/). Machine services from water and laser
  cutting, CNC machining, bending, forming, powder coating. 
* [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/). 3D printing services, along with
  other things. Historically they provided great service, but my last few orders
  with them were _very slow_.
