# Interesting Materials

I wanted to highlight some interesting materials that people may not know about.
These can easily solve a lot of problems when building things.

## Ultra-High Molecular Weight (UHMW) Polyethylene 

A [very neat
plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene)
that has a similar [coefficient of
friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction) (think how slick something is)
to PTFE (Teflon), but is substantially more abrasion resistance. It's available
in sheets, rods, and especially useful in [tape
form](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/uhmw-polyethylene-tape). 

## 3M VHB Tape

This is a situation where I'd call out a specific manufacturer's part. 3M has a
deserved reputation for being the master of adhesives, and [VHB
tape](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/vhb-tapes-us/) is a great example of their
skills. While not inexpensive (beware "cheap" partial rolls, they're almost
always fake), the tape can pull off miracles of making 2 things stick together.
The tape is strong enough that in some of its forms, it is used by automakers to
hold things together. The [design
guide](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1400379O/3m-vhb-tape-design-guide.pdf)
can help you figure out which would work for you.
