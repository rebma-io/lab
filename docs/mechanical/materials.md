# Interesting Materials

I wanted to highlight some interesting materials that people may not know about.
These can easily solve a lot of problems when building things.

## Butyl-Mastic Sheets

[Butyl
rubber](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/plastics-rubber/all-about-butyl-rubber/),
or just butyl, is a synthetic rubber. There are a bunch of different
versions, but there is a version that is is made as a blend with
[mastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastic_(plant_resin)) which is
available in sheets with adhesives and, typically, very thin aluminum
outer layer. So what good is it? Well, it is very useful for dampening
vibrations in cars (where you often see it added) and speakers. This is
the same basic compound, in a different formulation, that can be used in
some sealants. 

For example, I printed a 3D enclosure for some small speakers for a
project, and used butyl-mastic sheets to dampen the vibrations that the
plastic would otherwise exhibit. As a side benefit, it's quite dense, so
it adds a certain heft to the project.

## Ultra-High Molecular Weight (UHMW) Polyethylene 

A [very neat
plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene)
that has a similar [coefficient of
friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction) (think how slick something is)
to PTFE (Teflon), but is substantially more abrasion resistance. It's available
in sheets, rods, and especially useful in [tape
form](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/uhmw-polyethylene-tape). 

## 3M VHB Tape

This is a situation where I'd call out a specific manufacturer's part. 3M has a
deserved reputation for being the master of adhesives, and [VHB
tape](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/vhb-tapes-us/) is a great example of their
skills. While not inexpensive (beware "cheap" partial rolls, they're almost
always fake), the tape can pull off miracles of making 2 things stick together.
The tape is strong enough that in some of its forms, it is used by automakers to
hold things together. The [design
guide](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1400379O/3m-vhb-tape-design-guide.pdf)
can help you figure out which would work for you.

## Low Melt Alloys

> WARNING: **Some Metals Can Be Toxic** Many of the low melt alloys,
> such as Wood's metal, can be _very toxic_. While lead is a bad enough
> metal to work with, the cadmium resent in Wood's metal, and others, is
> exceptionally toxic in even smaller dosages. If you are going to work
> with these metals:
>
> 1. Work outside only. Do not hammer, melt, or otherwise manipulate the
>    metal indoors without _exceptionally good_ ventilation.
> 2. _Wear Gloves_. Always. No exception. Good ones. I exclusively use
>    [Kimberly-Clark nitrile
>    gloves](https://www.kcprofessional.com/en-us/products/scientific-and-research/lab-environment/hand-protection-and-gloves/kimberly-clark-nitrile-gloves/55090)
>    (available at many retailers for a reasonable price). I can't find
>    the reference, but they are 5 mil thick, which is a reasonably
>    thick glove. 

Low melt allows are mixtures of metals that have a melting point lower
than any of the constituent metals. They're useful for low-temperature
(as low as 47C) casting, and they are excellent for use in [gravity
casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_casting), which is super
simple. 

Typically, the lowest-temperature alloys are composed of some
combination of (in typical ratio/popularity):

* Bismuth
* Lead
* Tin
* Indium
* Cadmium
* Antimony

A lot of these also have colloquial names for them, such as [Field's
metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field%27s_metal), [Wood's
metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood%27s_metal), or [Rose's
metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose%27s_metal). Personally, I
avoid _anything_ with
[cadmium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium_poisoning).

A great source for these metals is
[Rotometals](https://www.rotometals.com/low-melt-fusible-alloys/) in San
Leandro, CA. I've bought from them repeatedly, and service is excellent,
they are responsive, and they ship quickly, even for small quantities. 

EXAMPLE: **Demonstrate Gravity Casting with PLA** Yes,
[PLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid) everyone's favorite
lactic acid polymer that prints lovely in FFF printers. There are some
eutectic alloys that melt low enough to _potentially be cast_ into a PLA
mould. PLA has a [glass transition
temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_transition) of
[60-65C](https://3dsolved.com/3d-filament-glass-transition-temperatures/),
which means there are at least two alloys we could use:
[Roto117F](https://www.rotometals.com/roto117f-low-melt-fusible-bismuth-based-ingot-alloy-ingot/Roto117F),
which is bismuth, cadmium, lead, tin, and indium, and
[Roto136F](https://rotometals.com/roto136f-low-melt-fusible-bismuth-based-ingot-alloy-ingot/),
which is bismuth, lead, tin, and indium. 

## Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) Glass

Indium-tin-oxide coated glass is a type of coated glass that is
semi-conductive. It actually forms, in most of its forms, a N-type
semiconductor. It  has very high light transmittance and relatively low
resistance (10-100&ohm;) per square cm. It can be either single or
double sided application. This is used in many touch screen designs,
some types of solar cells, and can also form a RF shield. One place you
can buy it is
[Techinstro](https://www.techinstro.com/ito-coated-glass/).
