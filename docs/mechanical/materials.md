# Interesting Materials

I wanted to highlight some interesting materials that people may not know about.
These can easily solve a lot of problems when building things.

## Ultra-High Molecular Weight (UHMW) Polyethylene 

A [very neat
plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene)
that has a similar [coefficient of
friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction) (think how slick something is)
to PTFE (Teflon), but is substantially more abrasion resistance. It's available
in sheets, rods, and especially useful in [tape
form](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/uhmw-polyethylene-tape). 

## 3M VHB Tape

This is a situation where I'd call out a specific manufacturer's part. 3M has a
deserved reputation for being the master of adhesives, and [VHB
tape](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/vhb-tapes-us/) is a great example of their
skills. While not inexpensive (beware "cheap" partial rolls, they're almost
always fake), the tape can pull off miracles of making 2 things stick together.
The tape is strong enough that in some of its forms, it is used by automakers to
hold things together. The [design
guide](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1400379O/3m-vhb-tape-design-guide.pdf)
can help you figure out which would work for you.

## Low Melt Alloys

> WARNING: **Some Metals Can Be Toxic** Many of the low melt alloys,
> such as Wood's metal, can be _very toxic_. While lead is a bad enough
> metal to work with, the cadmium resent in Wood's metal, and others, is
> exceptionally toxic in even smaller dosages. If you are going to work
> with these metals:
>
> 1. Work outside only. Do not hammer, melt, or otherwise manipulate the
>    metal indoors without _exceptionally good_ ventilation.
> 2. _Wear Gloves_. Always. No exception. Good ones. I exclusively use
>    [Kimberly-Clark nitrile
>    gloves](https://www.kcprofessional.com/en-us/products/scientific-and-research/lab-environment/hand-protection-and-gloves/kimberly-clark-nitrile-gloves/55090)
>    (available at many retailers for a reasonable price). I can't find
>    the reference, but they are 5 mil thick, which is a reasonably
>    thick glove. 

Low melt allows are mixtures of metals that have a melting point lower
than any of the constituent metals. They're useful for low-temperature
(as low as 47C) casting, and they are excellent for use in [gravity
casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_casting), which is super
simple. 

Typically, the lowest-temperature alloys are composed of some
combination of (in typical ratio/popularity):

* Bismuth
* Lead
* Tin
* Indium
* Cadmium
* Antimony

A lot of these also have colloquial names for them, such as [Field's
metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field%27s_metal), [Wood's
metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood%27s_metal), or [Rose's
metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose%27s_metal). Personally, I
avoid _anything_ with
[cadmium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium_poisoning).

A great source for these metals is
[Rotometals](https://www.rotometals.com/low-melt-fusible-alloys/) in San
Leandro, CA. I've bought from them repeatedly, and service is excellent,
they are responsive, and they ship quickly, even for small quantities. 


EXAMPLE: **Demonstrate Gravity Casting with PLA** Yes,
[PLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid) everyone's favorite
lactic acid polymer that prints lovely in FFF printers. There are some
eutectic alloys that melt low enough to _potentially be cast_ into a PLA
mould. PLA has a [glass transition
temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_transition) of
[60-65C](https://3dsolved.com/3d-filament-glass-transition-temperatures/),
which means there are at least two alloys we could use:
[Roto117F](https://www.rotometals.com/roto117f-low-melt-fusible-bismuth-based-ingot-alloy-ingot/Roto117F),
which is bismuth, cadmium, lead, tin, and indium, and
[Roto136F](https://rotometals.com/roto136f-low-melt-fusible-bismuth-based-ingot-alloy-ingot/),
which is bismuth, lead, tin, and indium.
