There are a few other advantages to using components extensively:</p> <ul> <li>The joints in the Assembly menu only work with components.</li> <li>Drawings can only be created from components. On activation, the   timeline is filtered. This means it will only show items in the   timeline that pertain to that component. The timeline on a big project   can become unwieldy, and this will make the quickly growing timeline   much easier to work with.</li> <li>When you export a component with \"save as\" Fusion 360 will also export   the complete parametric design history.</li> <li>Only components show on the BOM.</li> <li>Only components can be added to selection   sets.   Selection sets are a way to \"name\" a specific group of items that you   can refer to again and again consistently.</li> <li>Only components can be isolated. This allows you to make everything   but one component \"disappear\" from the design, and ensure you don't   accidentally affect them.</li> <li>You can make copies of a component, but keep linked changes (or not if   you want). This can be super helpful in larger assemblies. </li> </ul> <p>There's also a write up on the difference between components and bodies. This is super important to understand.

This allows you to create a keyboard shortcut for things in Fusion 360   that don't have one. This is especially useful in integrating with an   El Gato Stream Deck.</li> <li>Additive   Assistant.   Provides a bunch of additional analysis tools for FFF manufacturing around   things like overhang, warp, poor bed adhesion, etc. This runs in the Design   workspace.</li> <li>DirectName.   Rule #1: thou shalt always use components. Rule #2: name your stuff. This   prompts you to name everything (bodies, features, sketches, etc) immediately,   rather than creating them and then requiring you to go back and rename them.   While it is, initially, annoying, it sure does help keep things clean and   understandable in the timeline.</li> <li>Duplicate   Components.   Automates the steps for creating instances or creating duplicate   components in a design. This is great when you want to include things   like screws in your designs.</li> <li>GFGearGenerator.   Lets you design gears in 3D very simply. Won't go into anything super-exotic,   but it solves problems quickly.</li> <li>Install from   Github.   Not everything is on the Autodesk \"store\".

For this device, we get:</p> <p>The LM317 device is an adjustable three-terminal positive-voltage regulator capable of supplying more than 1.5 A over an output-voltage range of 1.25 V to 37 V. It requires only two external resistors to set the output voltage. The device features a typical line regulation of 0.01% and typical load regulation of 0.1%. It includes current limiting, thermal overload protection, and safe operating area protection. Overload protection remains functional even if the ADJUST terminal is disconnected.</p> <p>There's a few things here that aren't in the Features section. For example, we now know we'll need two resistors to set the output voltage, and that it has line and load regulation tolerance of 0.1%. Line regulation is the ability of the device to maintain a constant output voltage even with a varying input voltage. For example, the device should deliver 3.3V whether it's being driven with 4V or 12V. Load regulation is closely related, but it is the ability to maintain a constant voltage when the load (think amps) is varying. </p> <p>There's also a little detail about how the protection works. The three types of protection this device includes are:</p> <ul> <li>Current limiting. This means the device will limit the amount of   current that it delivers to ensure safety under all circumstances. For   example, if you were to short the device, it will ensure it behaves   properly. </li> <li>Thermal overload protection. The device will have protections to   ensure that if it gets too hot, it will shut itself off to keep from   having permanent damage. This is typically anything far outside the   recommended operating temperature.</li> <li>Safe operating area. Safe operating area (SOA) is something unique   to power devices (think transistors of many types). It is the   current and voltage conditions where it can be expected to operate   without damage. </li> </ul> <p>A quick read of this section is going to tell you whether this part is likely to work for your application or not.</p>"},{"location":"electronics/data-sheets/#part-number-device-information","title":"Part Number &amp; Device Information","text":"<p>A listing of all the variations of the part that the company produces.

A few notes about this one.</p> <p>First, you can see it's grouped into 3 groups along the I<sub>out</sub> dimensions. This is the maximum current that the device can produce safely. For example, the LM317M is only designed for 0.5A. </p> <p>Tolerance</p> <p> I'm going to talk about tolerance here, and, in the future, will discuss it in more detail because it's something that often trips up engineers. One thing, especially, to be aware of is tolerance stacking. Although this discusses it in a different context, the idea is similar.</p> <p>If we take the 1.5A primary parts, we can see a few things that differ. First, regulation accuracy differs. Earlier, I mentioned line and load regulation tolerance of 0.1%, so why does this say 1-1.5%? Well, the tolerance is about how the regulated output behaves under different input voltages and output loads. The regulation accuracy is how close to whatever you've set it to (let's say 3.3V) it actually hits. For 1.5%, this means 3.3V \u00b10.0495, or a value between 3.2505 and 3.3495. Good enough for nearly every use case.</p> <p>We can also see that some devices have a wider operating temperature range than others, and you can just assume those will cost you (sometimes substantially) more. Another dimension discussed here is PSRR (at 120Hz). This is the power supply rejection ratio, and is nearly always specified in decibels. Simplified, this is the ability of the device to reduce input supply noise in its output. Noise can be thought of as just the variations in the input supply. For example, in poorly isolated circuits, you can get mains frequency showing up in the DC side of the circuit.</p> <p>Finally, there are several lines (per package) that mention \\(T_{JA}\\), which is often written as \\(\\theta_{JA}\\). Either way, this is the thermal resistance between the junction of the transistor and ambient temperature. Where does this come in? Mostly if you want to calculate the allowed power dissipation (\\(P_{D(max)}\\)), where you use this equation: </p> \\[P_{D(max)} = {{T_{J(max)} -T_A}\\over{\\theta_{JA}}}\\] <p>Where \\(T_{J(max)}\\) is the maximum junction temperature, $T_A% is the ambient temperature the device is operating in, and we take \\(\\theta_{JA}\\) from before. </p> <p>But honestly, you don't need to worry about this most of the time.

This doesn't mean it's the only way to use it, but you would be well served to follow the advice if you don't understand why you might not. For example, if we were just puttering on a prototype board, we might leave the capacitors out, which would allow us to also leave out the diodes. But we shouldn't do that if we end up turning it into a PCB. </p> <p>We are then given the equation to set the output voltage using the two resistors:</p> \\[V_O = V_{\\mathit{ref}} ({1 + {R_2\\over R_1}) + (I_{adj} \\times R_2)}\\] <p>There's also a little note that \\(I_{adj}\\) is typically only 50uA, and therefore almost irrelevant since (assuming R2 is 220 ohm): \\(0.00005 \\times 220 = 0.011\\), and the \\(V_{ref} = 1.25V\\),  so we can simplify the equation to:</p> \\[V_O = 1.25 ({1 + {R_2\\over R_1}})\\] <p>Let's re-arrange so we can solve for just one of the resistors:</p> \\[R_1 = R_1({{V_O \\over 1.25} - 1})\\] <p>Now, let's assume we want 5V as an output:</p> \\[\\begin{aligned} R_2 &amp;= R_1({{5\\over 1.25} - 1})\\\\[5pt] &amp;= R_1(4 - 1)\\\\[5pt] &amp;= R_1 \\times 3 \\end{aligned} \\] <p>Now, if we just stick in 100 ohms for \\(R_1\\), we get \\(R_2 = 300\\). So we need R2 to be 300 ohms when R1 is 100 ohms. If we go back to the original equation, and we assume \\(I_{adj} = 50\\mu A\\), then we get:</p> \\[\\begin{aligned} V_O &amp;= V_{\\mathit{ref}} {({1 + {R_2\\over R_1}}) + (I_{adj} \\times R_2)}\\\\[5pt] &amp;= 1.25 ({1 + {300\\over 100}}) + (0.00005 \\times 100)\\\\[5pt] &amp;= 1.25 ({1 + 3}) + 0.005\\\\[5pt] &amp;= 1.25\\times 4 + 0.005\\\\[5pt] &amp;= 5.005 \\end{aligned} \\] <p>So, we are over by \\(5.005/5.000 = 0.1%\\).

It is the rate at which electrons flow past a specific point in a complete electrical circuit. A circuit is considered complete if there is a path for all electrons to flow in a \"loop\". Any component that converts electrical energy into some other form of energy (rotation, heat, light, even \"processing\") uses current.</p> <p>We measure current in ampere, or more often shortened to just amp. It expresses the quantity of electrons (aka electrical charge) flowing past a point in a circuit over a give time. A current of 1 amp can be translated as 1 coulomb of electrons, or 6.24 x 10<sup>18</sup> electrons moving past a single point in one second. It is traditional to compare electricity to water, and in this case, you'd talk about how many liters pass a single point in a hose in 1 minute (liter per minute). We use a few measurements regularly:</p> <ul> <li>A. Amperes (amps) for large amounts of current. You will typically   only see a small number of these in most applications, but in things   like electric cars, you might see hundreds of amps. High currents can   be very dangerous.</li> <li>mA. Milliampere (milliamp) is a typical unit in electronic circuits   that you'll work with. This is 0.001 ampere.</li> <li>\u00b5A. Microampere (microamps), or a millionth of an amp   (0.000001).</li> </ul> <p>There are smaller units, like picoamps, but outside of a very few specialized applications, you'll never see them, and you likely can't afford a device that can reliably even measure them. You can, if needed, construct a circuit to sneak up on the value, though.</p> <p>You will also see current referred to as I in things like Ohm's law (below). For the longest time, I had no idea why \"I\" was used, but it refers to the \"intensity\". For current to flow, two things must be true:</p> <ol> <li>A circuit that forms a closed conducting loop. This provides a loop    through which electrons can flow, and therefore providing energy    (electrons) to components along the loop. You can think of a loop    (circuit) as closed when you flip a light switch to the on position.</li> <li>The circuit must include a source of energy, such as a battery, that    produces voltage. Without voltage, electrons move randomly and evenly    within a wire, and therefore no current is flowing (think of still    pond water). When voltage creates pressure that will drive the    electrons in a single direction, like a stream.</li> </ol> <p>Current comes in two forms: direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). DC is what most electronics work with, and AC is what your house runs on. DC flows in a single direction, and therefore we can often talk about positive and negative connections. AC, as the name implies, alternates back and forth (a sine wave, technically) on a regular interval (60Hz in the United States, for example), and so we don't talk about positive and negative, but typically (at least in the US) \"hot\", \"neutral\", and \"ground\". Yes, it is not particularly obvious at first. This article might help, but typically, you won't be dealing with a lot of AC outside pre-built power supplies.</p> <p>Wire Gauge and Current</p> <p> Many things are sized based on the current with a much broader voltage range. For example, if we use the AWG wire standard, we can see that while 16 gauge solid core wire can carry a maximum of 15A, a 24 gauge 7-strand wire can only handle 1.4A. Typically, wire smaller than 24 gauge (i.e., with a larger gauge number) is treated as \"signal wire\", and only designed to carry tiny amounts of signal voltage (\u00b5A). This is also why on a PCB, we often need to use a trace width calculator.</p> <p></p> <p>We measure current with a multimeter most of the time. If we look at my trusty BK 2709B, we can see two different things. First, there are two different sections for measuring current, one for AC and another for DC. Second, while this multimeter is technically auto-ranging, you do have to tell it what magnitude of current to expect. This is for internal safety protections, and at least on my BK, while \u00b5A and mA use the same connector, the 10A measurement uses a different connector completely (and has different protection mechanisms inside). </p>"},{"location":"electronics/fundamentals/#voltage-pressure","title":"Voltage (pressure)","text":"<p>If current is the volume of electrons passing a point in a circuit, voltage is the pressure. To continue the water analogy, if current is the liters per minute, voltage is the pressure behind it where we measure water in (typically) either pounds per square inch (psi) or Pascals (Pa). We measure the voltage pressure in volts (V), which is named after Alessandro Volta, who invented the early precursor of the battery. You might occasionally hear voltage termed as electromotive force (EMF), which is why you'll sometimes see voltage expressed as the variable E. Mostly, the term comes up in discussions of back EMF.</p> <p>We often use the term voltage and potential difference interchangeably. Volts is the unit we use to express the potential energy difference between two points in a circuit. Potential energy is the potential to move electrons from one point to another, and because of that voltage exists only relatively. You cannot measure voltage at a point. You can only measure voltage between two points. This took me a long time to grasp because it's not super intuitive. The greater the voltage, the greater the ability to \"push\" more electrons and do more work.</p> <p>Like current, voltage comes in both direct and alternating forms. While this actually refers to the nature of the current that the voltage is moving, when measuring voltage, we need to deal with DC voltage (VDC) and AC voltage (VAC) differently, and if you look at the multimeter dial above, you can see there are similar settings for AC and DC voltage measurement. </p>"},{"location":"electronics/fundamentals/#power","title":"Power","text":"<p>In addition to the two fundamental measurements, voltage and current, we often talk about power (P).

Resistance is a measure of the opposition to current flow in an electrical circuit. It is measured in ohms, which is represented by the Greek letter omega (\u03a9). It is often represented in equations as the letter R.</p> <p>All materials resist current flow to some degree. They fall into one of two broad categories:</p> Conductors Materials that offer very little resistance where electrons can move easily. Examples: silver, copper, gold and aluminum. Insulators Materials that present high resistance and restrict the flow of electrons. Examples: Rubber, paper, glass, wood and plastic. <p>The higher the resistance, the lower the current flow; resistance is the primary reason all conductors give off some degree of heat, so overheating is an issue often associated with resistance. The lower the resistance, the higher the current flow.</p> <p>Many components, such as resistors, have a fixed-resistance value. Resistance is a property of the materials being used, as well as their physical dimensions. You can calculate the resistance as:</p> \\[R = \\rho{L\\over A}\\] <p>where \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area (in meters), and \\(L\\) is the length (also in meters). \\(\\rho\\) is the intrinsic  resistive property of the material, although it does change with temperature. </p> <p>For example, here's a few different materials and their \\(\\rho\\) values:</p> Material \\(\\rho\\) at 20C Copper \\(1.68\\times 10^{-8}\\) Aluminum \\(2.82\\times 10^{-8}\\) Iron \\(1.0\\times 10^{-7}\\) Sea water \\(2.0\\times 10^{-1}\\) Air \\(2.3\\times 10^{16}\\) (approximately) <p>So, for a 10cm length of 26ga solid core copper wire (don't you love mixing weird measurement units), you could calculate this using the equation earlier:</p> \\[\\begin{aligned} R &amp;= 1.68\\times 10^{-8} {0.1\\over{1.4\\times 10^{-7}}}\\\\[5pt] &amp;= 0.0000000168 {0.1\\over{0.00000014}}\\\\[5pt] &amp;= 0.012 \\end{aligned}\\] <p>This means that our 10cm length of wire has a resistance of 0.012\u03a9. Note that stranded wire would have a slightly different value which is the aggregate of the cross-section of each strand multiplied by the number of strands. </p> <p>Equivalent Source Resistance (ESR)</p> <p> Often, you will hear people talk bout the the ESR of a component. For example, when you have a voltage divider (see here), and you attach a load which has some resistance, the voltage will actually drop due to a finite source resistance. ESR refers to the hypothetical Thevenin equivalent resistance of the circuit . Nearly everything has an ESR, and there are tools, such as LCR meters, that can help you determine it if it's not provided on a datasheet. </p> <p>The undesirable reduction of voltage mentioned above is a result of what is called circuit loading, and what designers mean when they refer to the load of a circuit.

So, I'm going to try and explain it how I understand it, and how I think about it. This is likely not 100% correct, but it is hopefully 84% useful.</p> <p>While many of the preceding characteristics are true of both fixed/constant currents and alternating currents, inductance is, effectively, purely about alternating currents. Inductance is the characteristic of an electrical component which opposes changes in current. We measure inductance in Henries (H), and typically use the symbol L to represent them. One Henry is a lot of inductance. </p> <p>I like to think of inductance as the inertia of a component in the circuit. Inertia is the characteristic of mass which opposes a change in velocity. Inductance does the same thing in an electrical circuit. This means that it requires more energy to start or stop the flow of current than it does to maintain it.</p> <p>Every conductor has some inductance. This is because current in a conductor will always produce a magnetic field surrounding the conductor (see Faraday's Law). When the current changes, the magnetic field changes, which will induce an electromotive force (EMF). For reasons I don't 100% understand, this is always counter to the applied voltage, creating the inductance or opposition to change. This is defined by Lenz' Law, which states:</p> <p>The current induced in a circuit due to a change in a magnetic field is directed to oppose the change in [magnetic] flux and to exert a mechanical force which opposes the motion.</p> <p>Inductance comes in two forms: self-inductance and mutual-inductance. Put simply, self-inductance is when one conductor induces inductance in itself. Mutual-inductance is when one conductor also induces inductance in another conductor. Examples of mutual inductance include motors, transformers, and solenoids. </p> <p>There's a lot of math, but I think that if you understand that it is about the opposition to changes in current you'll get reasonably far.</p>"},{"location":"electronics/fundamentals/#impedance","title":"Impedance","text":"<p>Complex Numbers Ahead</p> <p> I'm going to try and avoid the complex numbers as much as possible, but it's not totally avoidable when talking about impedance.

This simulation idealizes many components. Wires and component leads have no resistance. Voltage sources are ideal - they will try and supply infinite current if you let them.

It is slightly acidic, which helps activate it. No-Clean Flux This is a rosin-style flux with minimal activation (mostly acidity). This means you don't have to remove it after assembly. Unfortunately, it's also less effective at preparing the board for soldering. Also, you should clean it anyway, as it can leave a sticky residue. Water-Soluble Flux This is based on a totally synthetic resin base. It is still quite corrosive (even more so than rosin in some ways), which does lead to a well-prepared surface, but it also means it must be cleaned as well. It may generate less harmful fumes due to its use of water as a solvent."},{"location":"electronics/soldering/#composition-of-solder-leadlead-free","title":"Composition of Solder (Lead/Lead-Free)","text":"<p>There are two major categories of solder: lead and lead-free.

There are two primary formulations in use:</p> <ul> <li>60Sn/40Pb</li> <li>63Sn/37Pb</li> </ul> <p>The main difference between the two is in how they melt and solidify. 60/40 solder becomes plastic around 183C and fully melts at 188C. The range between (183-188C) is considered the plastic region. Because it can spend more time in this plastic region, it has a higher tendency of forming a cold solder joint.</p> <p>What is a cold solder joint?</p> <p> A cold solder joint is one where the joint has not been properly heated and did not melt completely. It can happen for a number of reasons: using too little heat, not applying heat evenly, or not applying heat for long enough. Cold solder joints are weaker than proper ones and can cause electrical problems.</p> <p>You can tell a solder joint is cold by looking at it under a magnifying glass. A cold solder joint will look dull or grainy, while a well-soldered one will be shiny and smooth. You can also try to move the component. If the joint is weak, the component will move slightly.</p> <p>63/37 solder, on the other hand, is a eutectic. Unlike 60/40 solder, 63/37 melts and becomes solid at a singe temperature (183C), eliminating its plastic region and reducing the possibility of cold solder joints. One minor bonus is that 63/37 solder solidifies into a slightly shinier and smoother surface. It's also slightly more expensive.</p> <p>Which should you use? Either.

Note that each of these has a specific schematic symbol you can find on this page. I've taken part photographs from Digikey; part number in the alt text.</p> Through-hole axial lead  This is the \"classic\" resistor. There are standard package sizes and shapes, and they are effectively interchangeable from manufacturer to manufacturer.  Surface mount device (chip)  Like everything these days, resistors come in a diverse set of surface mount formats, which are typically called \"chip resistors\".  They start out huge at 2512 format (0.25\" x 0.12\") but quickly shrink until you get to the 0201 (0.024\" x 0.012\"). <p>In addition to the normal through-hole and SMD resistors, there's a few that are variable. The first are adjustable:</p> Potentiometer  A potentiometer is an adjustable resistor with 3 terminals. One terminal is connected to an adjustable wiper, and the other two are connected to opposite ends of a resistive component. The position of the wiper turned with a knob. It effectively is a self-contained voltage divider. Note there is a digital potentiometer which kinda does the same thing, but accomplishes the entire process with a large number of resistors switched in and out of the circuit. Trimming potentiometer (trimpot)   A trimpot is very close to a potentiometer, but I wanted to call it out specifically. Trimpots are basically potentiometers that are mounted on a PCB and are intended exclusively for trimming (tuning or calibrating) a circuit. They come in single turn and in multi-turn models, and they are designed to be very precise and stable. They run the gamut from $0.25 (USD) to $50+ (USD) depending on accuracy and temperature coefficient, which is basically how much they change over a temperature range. <p>Then, there is a set of resistors that are reactive to the environment. </p> Photoresistor  Also called light-dependent resistors, photoresistors are, as you might imagine from the name on the tin, reactive to photons (light). They typically drop resistance the more light that falls on them. This range is called their \"dark resistance\" (R<sub>D</sub>) and their \"illuminated resistance\" (R<sub>IL</sub>). All the ones I've seen get less resistive as more light falls on them. They can be very useful for detecting the presence of things, although typically photodiodes are more useful in this area. NTC/PTC thermistor  A thermistor is a resistor whose resistance changes significantly with temperature. I say significantly, because all resistors change with temperature to some degree or another. They come in two different kinds: negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and... you guessed it, positive temperature coefficient (PTC). As for applications, they're actually quite different (largely due to how they're constructed). NTC thermistors are typically used as temperature sensors.   PTC thermistors, however, are used in over-current protection, or some form of self-regulator circuit. NTC respond quickly, where as PTC respond much slower. In fact, you'll often hear \"PTC resettable fuse\" used to refer to the PTC kind when they're used in protection circuits. Varistor A varistor, also called a voltage-dependent resistor (VDR) is actually a semiconductor that drops in resistance as voltage increases. Their main application is in protection circuits where they are tied to ground. When they are set up in this arrangement, they're called \"voltage clamping\". The most common kind in use is a metal-oxide varistor (MOV).  Strain Gauge   One  of the last environmentally-reactive resistors is a strain gauge. A strain gauge measures, shockingly, strain on an object. Strain is the deformation of an object. Through that, they can be used to measure weight (typically through a Wheatstone bridge). Strain gauges are capable of tolerances down below 0.2%, and are heavily used to monitor equipment and aircraft.","tags":["component","passive","resistor"]},{"location":"electronics/passives/resistors/#composition","title":"Composition","text":"<p>There are a bunch of ways to make resistors, but for a majority of them, they have one of the following compositions. I've linked to much more in-depth reviews of the various types along with trade-offs. I mostly keep carbon-film and metal-film resistors around for most uses, with a few wirewound for higher power applications. These are listed (approximately) from cheapest to most expensive.</p> Carbon composition Carbon composition resistors (CCR) are fixed value resistors. They are made out of fine carbon particles mixed with a binder (for example clay). After baking, it has a solid form.  Carbon film Carbon film resistors are a type of fixed value resistor. They are constructed out of a ceramic carrier with a thin pure carbon film around it. This carbon film functions as the resistive material.  Metal film Metal film resistors have a thin metal layer as resistive element on a non-conducting body. They are among the most common types of axial resistors.   Metal oxide film Metal oxide film resistors are made of ceramic rod that is coated with a thin film of metal oxides, such as tin oxide. Metal oxide film resistors must not be confused with metal oxide varistors, made of zinc oxide or silicon carbide. Wirewound In a wirewound resistor, the resistive element is an insulated metallic wire that is wound around a core of non-conductive material. The wire material has a high resistivity, and is usually made of an alloy such as nickel-chromium (Nichrome) Foil A foil resistor is a high precision component to limit electric current.

While not strictly a measurement itself, it's a system of standardized measurements. It was originally standardized in 1952 by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and is effectively followed by every single resistor manufacturer in the world. By standardizing resistors, it also accelerated the mass production, and turned them into jellybean part. It also limits the number of values that have to be manufactured and stocked. There are 6 commonly used E-series:</p> <ul> <li>E6 for 20% tolerance resistors.</li> <li>E12 for 10%</li> <li>E24 for 5% and 1%</li> <li>E48 for 2%</li> <li>E96 for 1%</li> <li>E192 for 0.5%, 0.25%, and 0.1%</li> </ul> <p>Resistors with higher tolerance ranges need fewer distinct parts to cover the range because they automatically overlap. Each of these is a series of steps on a logarithmic scale. So, for an E12, the step is equal to:</p> \\[10^{1\\over{12}} = 1.21\\] <p>Similarly, for E192, we get:</p> \\[10^{1\\over{192}} = 1.01\\] <p>That leads us to a series of [1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, 2.2, 2.7, 3.3, 3.9, 4.7, 5.6, 6.8, 8.2].

In a dynamic load, some external factor causes the forces of the load to change.</p> <p>Some of the factors that can affect a load and convert it to dynamic include: </p> <ul> <li>Movement. If the load is in motion, the force created by the weight   distribution could (and will) change.</li> <li>Increased tension.

In the drawing, the shaft assembly pushes radially on the inner ring of the bearing transferring a load through the rolling elements to the outer ring.</p> <p>Radial loads don\u2019t transfer force equally or uniformly onto the rolling elements.

This is also called a thrust load (see thrust bearing later). Usually, you\u2019ll find an axial load directly in line with the shaft, like you would see on a drill.

It\u2019s wider than the shank and thread. Heads can be flat or domed. Some are tapered to fit flush. Drive This is where your screwdriver's tip goes. This comes in a lot of different designs as discussed below. Shank Not all screws have threads all the way down. Partial thread screws offer an section below the head that is entirely free of threading. This non-thread area of a screw is called the shank or shoulder and will vary in length depending on the bolt's application. Threads The thread is the structure that converts between rotational and linear force. A screw thread is a wrapped around a cylinder (or cone) in the form of a helix. When it's wrapped around a cylinder, it's termed a straight thread, while a cone has a tapered thread. While a vast majority of screws have a right hand thread, there are some with left hand threads, and they can be quite surprising when you find them. Thread Pitch The thread pitch is distance in between threads that make a difference. It is measured from the crest of one thread to the same point on the next thread. Some screws have thread that are small and close together, while other screws have larger threads spaced further apart.  Thread Length This is the total length of the thread, which is not necessarily the entire length of the screw.  Tip The point is  where the screw enters whatever material you\u2019re putting the screw into. If no point (i.e. flat tip),  some people might call it a bolt, but that's a point discussed above. Screws meant for different materials, specifically self-tapping screws, will have very different tip designs to engage with the material properly. Major Diameter (Gauge) The major diameter is the diameter at the widest part of the thread (i.e. outer part of the thread). This part of the thread is called the crest. This is also commonly called the gauge of the screw. Minor Diameter The minor diameter is the thickness at the base of the screw without the threads. For example, imagine if the threads were removed. The remaining shaft would be the minor diameter).","tags":["corrosion","joints","screws"]},{"location":"mechanical/screws/#metric-versus-imperial","title":"Metric versus Imperial","text":"<p>There Can be Only One</p> <p> There is a war between metric and imperial, and, if we're being honest, imperial should have lost decades ago, but the stubbornness of the United States keeps it, sadly relevant. </p> <p>While it would be nice to simply have a single system for screws, this is not the world we exist in, at least in the United States.

A few things are materially different between the two:</p> <ul> <li>Metric and imperial screws measure thread pitch totally differently.   Metric measures the distance between crests of the pitch (0.5mm for   example), while imperial measures the number of threads in an inch.</li> <li>Metric screws are always specified in a clear major diameter and   length. For example, an M4x0.5 screw is 4mm in major diameter and   0.5mm thread pitch, excluding the head. Imperial screws are specified   with a number, like a #6 screw. A #6 screw has a major diameter of   0.138in or 3.51mm.

For example, the microphone is a project. To collect lots of common parts, parts which can be part of lots of different, the projects <code>000</code>-<code>099</code> are used to potentially hold lots of common parts. <code>$component</code> (regex: <code>\\d{4}</code>) This can be either an assembly or a part.

This comes with both charms, but also unique challenges. For me, that's:</p> <ol> <li>This is directly under the roof, so the roof starts about 48\" off the    floor, and slopes up at something around 55 degrees to a 2' wide    center section at the ridge. This makes for some space challenges    when you're 6'3\" tall as well.</li> <li>There isn't a huge amount of modern electrical service. The house, as    a whole, has only 80A service, which means I have to pay attention to    what I plug in and run simultaneously.</li> <li>It's carpeted.

Here's a quick panorama:</p> <p></p> <p>I've tried to cram in everything I need, but I've had to make some (a lot) of compromises along the way. The work area is composed of IKEA birch veneer tabletops sitting on a combination of metal legs and a 5 drawer unit.</p> <p>Rigidity Improvement</p> <p> Currently, they aren't physically joined, but just butted up against one another.

Likely some strapping with a few self-taping wood screws will be plenty to hold in place. and hold them flat at the same time.</p> <p>Sitting on the main desk is a large Bertech ESD soldering mat, which I discuss more elsewhere. I then have a bodged together self composed of some red oak stair treads from my local lumber yard placed on shiny chrome-plated IKEA kitchen cabinet legs. These are adjustable and can handle a lot of weight. I specifically, wanted them to be able to be a reasonable height so that I could use the space under the shelf. There's also a small IKEA LED strip that provides a bit of extra light under the shelf.</p> <p>Finally, I have a USB DisplayLink monitor from Asus that's mounted to an inexpensive Monoprice bracket which alows me to keep it above my laptop (a ThinkPad X1 Yoga that I've had forever and probably needs updating since getting Windows 11 on it was a chore).</p> <p>Next to that is the drawer cabinets that I keep a bunch of parts in, and then past that some bookcases. The only cabinet worth discussing is the one directly under the desk. I've arranged the drawers for:</p> <ul> <li>Writing &amp; Notes. This is pens, paper pads, 3x5 note cards, small   scissors, and a calculator basically. A lot of   pens.</li> <li>Small hand tools. These are extra sets of pliers, multi-bit   screwdriver kits, security screwdriver kit, small metal   roller.</li> <li>Medium hand tools. This is a soft-faced hammer, all my crimpers and   cutters, etc, and large screw drivers.</li> <li>Measurement. Here is where I store my calipers, micrometers, levels,   and other things I used regularly to measure something.</li> <li>Safety and Cleaning.

I'll try to walk through the steps anyway.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 1. Open the box. There are some self-tapping Phillips head screws on the back which need to be removed. You can see the absurd alligator clips here. At the top, there are three tabs which insert into the meter's slots and provide the four wire measurement as well as a \"guard\" connection. We won't be touching the gard connection in this project.</p> <p>Guard What?</p> <p> It always puzzled me, until I talked to a friend who used to work for HP Test &amp; Measurement (note, this is the real HP, and not whatever monstrosity now uses the name). The guard connection is used to help minimize noise and reduce the parasitic effects coming from the component being measured. This can get you much higher precision. I never use it.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 2. One you have the box open, you can see the internal parts. There's a small PCB with with the connections from the alligator clips. There are 6 connections: connections 1, 2, and ground for each positive (+) and negative (-). The grounds are not labeled, but the others are labeled \"-1\", etc. As far as I am aware of, there's really no difference in most clip designs between 1 and 2, as they join together at the tip and are designed to be as close to identical in length as possible. This reduces any differences in the measurement due to length difference in the clips themselves. Keep note of this idea, as it's important.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 3. Now we need to remove all the screws holding the PCB into the plastic case. Like the exterior screws, these are all self-tapping ones. There are 4 of them, since I missed 1 the first time. For some reason, these are non-ferrous, and so magnetic screwdrivers won't help. Make sure you keep them safe because they are tiny. I use these neat little 3d printed trays from @Area51. Print lots of them! </p> <p></p> <p>Step 4. Once you have the PCB out of its case, set the case to the side. You should take a close look at the PCB, just to make sure you understand exactly how it's wired up together. I recommend taking a picture with your phone so you can see all the connections. We will be replicating these later.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 5. Now, we need to remove the little zip tie that's been attached through 2 small holes in the PCB. You can use some form of snips, as I did in this case with a pair of flush cutters (my personal go-to for most any job). This little zip tie forms a strain relief to reduce strain on the solder joints. We will be replicating this later.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 6. Next, we put the PCB in some kind of holder. Here, I'm using my favorite, an Omnifixo. This will hold the PCB securely while we're working. While you can try and use your hands, I try to keep my fingers as far away from the hot tip of a soldering iron as I can. You should too. As you can see from the photo, the solder is actually on the bottom of the PCB, so we'll need to flip it over.</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 7.  Once you flip the PCB over, you can go to removing the solder. Here, I'm using a solder sucker to remove the solder itself. You may need to clean up a little bit with solder wick when you're done. I find that pulling gently on the wires as you're heating them helps pull them out more easily. I'm not sure what solder was used on this PCB originally, but it required quite alot of heat, and I had to crank my soldering iron to 400C to get things to come out.</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 8. Now we have the wires and ground pulled off, we should inspect the PCB to make sure there's nothing wrong. What I'm typically looking for is damage to the pads or traces. I was especially worried about it this time because of the amount of heat that was required to get the solder to melt and come off. Fortunately, there didn't appear to be any major damage to anything.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 9. After examining things, we want to clean the PCB. I use IPA for this job, and give it a good scrub with a cotton swab. I want to make sure I get any residue off the board so that we can get a good solder joint when we put the new leads on. However much IPA you used, use more. It's inexpensive, and it cleans really well, and you can never have too clean a surface on a PCB.</p> <p>Missing Pictures</p> <p> This is where I messed up and didn't take a lot of pictures, so I'm going to try and just walk you through the steps.</p> <p>Step 10. Now it's time to bring in the new clips! The first step is to [not shown] clip the cables off. You want to do this as accurately and evenly as possible. I pulled them tight, and then held them while I cut all 4 (a pair per clip) at the same time. We want to make sure we pay attention to consistency with the clips. It's not as important how long they are, but that they're all the same length.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 11. Now that you have your cables cut-to-length, we need to figure out how much needs to be stripped. We want to strip the outer insulation back to a just ahead of the strain relief zip tie mentioned earlier. I found that holding them against the PCB and marking them with a pen (in this case a white pen) was the most useful.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Step 12. Now you need to strip the cables. I use my somewhat fancy Irwin automatic cable stripper, which magically just do the right thing. You'll want to strip the outer insulation back to the marking. Then, take the very fine wire that makes up the outer shielding and pull it all to one side and twist it together as shown to the right. Be careful doing this that you get all of the wires. They tend to be very fine, and if you accidentally miss one you could end up shorting the shield to the conductor, which would result in very poor measurements, or worse. </p> <p>Step 13. Now you need to strip the inner insulation back to expose the conductor. Here you only want to strip off 3-5mm of insulation. We want to ensure the wire is insulated as close to the final solder joint as possible. This will reduce the risk of any shorts and protect the wire over time.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 14. Now comes tinning of the wires. We tin the wires to hold all the strands together and prepare them for soldering to the contact pad later. By doing this, we make the later soldering much more reliable and easier. Skipping this step just makes more work later.</p> <p>Just heat the wire up and run the solder along it. The first time will feel weird, but after that you'll be able to do it quite quickly.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 15. Now is the time on Sprockets were we solder. I start on the inside wires (-2 and +2), and work my way out. Put a little bit of solder on the pad itself first, then press the wire against the pad, heat it, and the combination of the solder on the pad and the tinned wire should quickly solder together. If they don't, you might need a little bit more solder on the pad to start. </p> <p>This is where the Omnifixo (or any other \"helping hands\") comes into its own. It helps you hold the wire in the right place as you're soldering to ensure that you get a good contact, without risking putting your tender flesh close to the solder tip.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 16. Final examination. Look at all the solder joints. They should look reasonably shiny. If they are really rough looking, you should add some flux (a flux pen is great from this) and reheat them to let them set correctly. We don't want a cold solder joint. Now is also the time where you can pull out the IPA again and give the board a good wipe down and cleaning. We especially don't want any residual flux on something where we are hoping to make precise measurements. Flux has some conductance (and resistance) and will interfere potentially. Note, this picture was before cleaning the flux off the PCB.</p> <p>Step 17. Finally, we re-assemble it. I haven't shown these because, quite honestly, it's just a reverse of opening it. First, though, insert a plastic zip tie through the two small holes where the original one was. Don't tighten it just yet, just make sure it's sticking out around the cables. Then, insert the PCB back into the plastic box, making sure to get the  Add the 4 tiny PCB screws. Once those are tightened, complete the zip tie, tightening it snugly and trimming the excess. Finally, reattach the top to the case.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 18.  Stick a label on that sucker.</p> <p>Seriously though, I tend to label anything like this so that I know what and when this was done. Especially since the box itself has a part number that wouldn't map correctly. </p> <p>That brings us to a point where we need to figure out if this thing even works. To do that, we're going to stick it in the meter and give it a try. </p> <p></p> <p>Step 19. Calibrate the clips. For my meter, this means pressing the CAL button for 2 seconds, then going through a calibration with the clips open (not connected) and then with the clips shorted (connected). Doing this calibrates out the wire itself so that the meter can measure just the DUT. Each of those steps takes 30 seconds, then you can use the meter. </p> <p>While you don't have to do this every single time you use the meter, it's not a bad habit to get into to do it frequently. Environmental influences, like temperature, can impact the readings.</p>","tags":["lcr","measurement","project","tools"]},{"location":"projects/LCR-meter-Kelvin-clips/#lcr-meter-use","title":"LCR Meter Use","text":"<p>Speed Run</p> <p> This is just the most absolutely simplified use of an LCR meter, and I'll be writing up a more detailed dive on what and how to use LCR meters in the future.

First, let's talk about what a telescoping gauge is. It's a metrology device that is used to measure the inside diameter (ID) of a hole.

One downside to telescoping gauges is they aren't super repeatable across machinists. Once you have a feel for using a specific set, you can get pretty repeatable readings, but your feel and someone else's feel, are not super close when you're working at a scale that metrology concerns itself with typically (thousandths of an inch). Still, for most things, it's good enough.</p> <p>To use it, there's a few steps:</p> <ol> <li>First, you need to collapse both the measuring heads by manually    pushing them in, and then rotating the locking screw at the end of    the handle counter-clockwise.  </li> <li>Place the gauge into the bore with one head held in place against the    wall of the bore.

Instead, this is about an improvement that I made to it recently. One of my frustrations with the microscope, which is overall excellent, was the light-weight aluminum base. It was both insubstantial (something you don't want in a microscope), and non-magnetic, which prevented me from using my favorite holding tools. So, since the the overall design was just 2 holes in a plate, I decided to make something better.</p> <p></p> <p>Since I needed it to be magnetic, I turned to my old friend, steel. I designed a small replacement that also had holes for 4 adjustable self-balancing feet. To do this, I did some quick measurements, and created a quick 2D file in DXF format (joyalens-replacement-base-v1.dxf ). I then shot it over to SendCutSend to be manufactured in 1/4\" (6.3mm) hot-rolled pickled and oiled A36 steel.

It's the  one you've seen on the back of a cereal box. In fact, the first UPC  barcode ever scanned was a pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit chewing gum.  It is widely applied to retail in the United States. It is also known  as Universal Product Code version A. You can't just generate your own  UPC-A code, as the assignment of manufacturer ID numbers is controlled  in the USA by the Uniform Code Council (UCC),  which is now just known as GS1 US.</p> <p>UPC-A is a subset of EAN-13 (the European counterpart and largely interchangeable). To be specific, an UPC-A bar code is an EAN-13 bar code with the first EAN-13 number system digit set to \"0\". Beyond this, UPC-A barcode is able to convert to UPC-E. A UPC-A barcode consists of 12 digits. It begins with a single digit number system character, which designates how the code should be classified: as a regular product, a weighted item, pharmaceuticals, coupons, etc. After that is a five digit manufacturer's number, followed by a five digit product number, and finally a check digit. Each digit is represented by a uniquely identifiable pattern of two bars and two spaces of varying width. No letters or other special characters aside from numbers may be used.</p> <p>A mathematical  formula  computes the check digit from the other numbers.. So if the check digit  doesn't match the digit generated by the other numbers, you know  immediately that there's an error.</p> Advantages UPC-A barcodes are simple, short, popular, and can be read by just  about any standard barcode reader. In addition, the check digit guards  against accidental errors, especially when entering in the code by  hand.  Disadvantages The 12 digit system of a UPC-A barcode provides for small, limited  encoding, which makes it ideal for supermarket and retail use, but less  suited for other scanning and identification purposes.

Typically, the scanner will convert this to a <code>*</code>. Aside from the start/end character, the barcode can technically only encode the numbers 1-10. To encode letters, it uses special designations. It does this by dividing them up into categories:</p> <ul> <li>For example, the first 10 letters (A-J) are given numeric values,   preceded by a \"Letters\" designation. </li> <li>The next 10 (K-T) are designated \"Letters +10.\" So K would be Letters   +10, followed by a 1, showing that it's the 11th letter of the   alphabet. </li> <li>The last set (U-Z) then become \"Letters +20.\" </li> </ul> <p>Numbers, of course, have their own designation as well.</p> Advantages The use of both letters and numbers makes Code 39 more versatile. In addition, it is self-checking, so it does not require a check number (though one  is still recommended). Disadvantages It is limited to a maximum of 43 characters. Also, its method of assigning number values to letters in order to read them limits versatility and precludes other characters. It also makes decoding the barcode more complicated. <p>There is a related Code 93 barcode that is used by Canada Post that has more density, but is otherwise very similar.</p>","tags":["software","barcodes","computer-vision"]},{"location":"software/barcode-formats/#code-128","title":"Code 128","text":"<p>Code 128 is a denser barcode than most, but it is also the most versatile barcode in the 1-D category, in terms of potential information storage.

It is most commonly used in the logistics of things like purchasing and shipping, but can potentially be used for a variety of other purposes.  </p> <p>There are six sections to a Code 128 barcode. The first and last sections are both quiet zones, which consist of a certain amount of white space, based on other elements of the code. After the opening quiet zone is a start character, which designates what code set the barcode falls into. Code 128 has three code sets:</p> <ul> <li>Set A designates codes with all capital letters. </li> <li>Set B is for codes with both capital and lower case letters.</li> <li>Set C is for codes with only numeric data -- which allows it to   compress twice as much data into the same space. </li> </ul> <p>After the start character comes the data itself. Each encoded character consists of exactly three bars and three spaces. After that is a check digit, to ensure accuracy, followed by an end character to signify the end of the code, and finally the closing quiet zone.</p> Advantages Not only is Code 128 versatile, it is compact, being able to store a much larger amount of data than a regular barcode in the same amount of space.

We will start with a diagram of all the pieces on the Clockwise digital caliper that I use most of the time. Others will be slightly different, but will generally follow the same design.</p> <p></p> Beam The beam is the main material piece of the caliper upon which everything else rides. The precision and accuracy by which this is manufactured will determine the overall accuracy and precision you can  achieve with the tool. More expensive tools are simply manufactuered to  much higher standards, and sometimes with much more expensive (and  reliable) materials. When a caliper is said to be 150mm, it means that the beam is designed for up to 150mm measurements. Everything else is on the beam in some fashion. On the beam, you will find printed the main scale. This is the overall  dimensions of the caliper. In addition, along the sides you will find a  reference surface. This is used during the calibration of the caliper  and is, in better calipers, has a lapped finish to mirror levels to achieve near perfect flatness. Slider The slider is the component that is moving along the beam, and  contains the measurement display as well as a few other things. First, it  contains a locking screw, which is used to hold the slider in place,  especially during storage (see headnote). It also contains the  power/zero button which can be used to zero the caliper or set the  origin (see below). Finally, for most digital calipers, there is a units  button of some sort that allows it to change from millimeters to  decimal inches, and potentially fractional inches. If you want to take a  measurement in both, I strongly recommend tightening the locking screw  before pressing any button to ensure that you get an accurate and  consistent measurement. Thumb Roller The thumb roller is used to bring a caliper into contact with the  surface you are attempting to measure. You should never slam the jaws into  the surface, but instead bring them close, then slowly ease into the  surface using the thumb roller. This will ensure that you do not apply too  much pressure, and typically will get a much more consistent measurement. Jaws The jaws are hold the measuring faces (below), and are what moves to  allow for different measurements. Measuring faces There are two different measuring faces on a set of calipers,  depending on what you are attempting to measure. If you are measuring the  outside of something (think outside diameter of a pipe), you would use the  outside measuring faces. For measuring the inside of things (again,  think inside diameter of a pipe), you use the inside measuring faces. In  the section below on use, I'll talk a bit more about how exactly to use them. Depth bar and measuring surface Sometimes, you want to measure the depth of something; a hole, for  example. To do this, you can use the little bit at the end that extends  called the depth bar, and the depth measuring surface. By sticking  this in a hole, you can identify the real depth of the hole. For the longest  time, I didn't understand the odd shape of the depth bar, but this  question and answer on Stack Overflow  provides a clear explanation with diagrams, and it's worth a read.","tags":["calipers","measurement","micrometers"]},{"location":"tools/using-calipers/#setting-the-origin","title":"Setting the Origin","text":"<p>Before using your calipers, you need to ensure the origin is correct. To  do this, clean the blades with a soft cloth to make sure they're  clean (even small amounts of dust can imapct measurement accuracy). Then  you can close the jaws (carefully, don't slam them) using the thumb roller. It should read 0.0mm, but if it doesn't make sure they're clean, and  then you can press the zero/origin button to set the origin. </p> <p>More Expensive Calipers</p> <p> On higher-end calipers, the origin is  set at the factory, and there should never be a need to set it. It may  only need to be set when the battery is changed on the calipers, but  otherwise it will stay in correct alignment. This is one way the pricier  models differ. It's a couple seconds, but it can add up.</p> <p>Relative Measurement</p> <p> There are occasions, especially in machining, where you are attepting to understand the difference between where you are  and where you want to be. For example, if you are turning a piece of metal  on a lathe, and you want it to be 17mm exactly, you can set the calipers to 17mm (ideally using gauge blocks),  and then zeroing them on this point. On more expensive calipers, there's  typically a \"relative\" button that you use for this.

They're hardly required, but they are a huge quality-of-life improvement.

Personally, I use a a Varmillo MAv2 keyboard with Cherry MX Clear switches. Sadly, Varmillo doesn't offer the Cherry switches any more. The MX Clears have been my go-to because they offer great tactile feedback, but without the noise that comes with many. I would love to use my Unicomp keyboard with it's glorious buckling-springs, but it's simply far too loud if I have to do calls with people, and I share these peripherals with my work laptop.</p> <p>The keyboard is augmented with a set of Dasher MT3 keycaps, because you can never have enough glorious '70s Data General colors. Seriously, we lost something when we abandoned the land of color for whatever we have now, and I don't mean gaudy RGB lighting of everything. I don't want my computer to be like a Las Vegas casino.</p> <p>For navigation, I'm a big trackball fan. I don't think I've really used anything else when sitting at a desk for decades. My go-to trackball is the Kensington Export Mouse with a big honk'n 55mm ball in it. It's just glorious. If I have any complaint, it's that the scroll wheel around the ball is a bit crunchy, and in spite of my best efforts, I've never figured out why. </p> <p>To put photons in my eyeballs, I have a pair of Dell U2723QE 27\" 4k monitors, in spite of the best efforts by certain people trying to convince me to pop for an Apple Studio Display. It might be marginally better quality, but it costs more than both the Dell displays, and that's 14,745,600 versus 16,588,800 pixels for the twins, and as you'll see below, I use the twin monitors to my advantage for more than extra real-estate. Those are mounted on a gigantic Ergotron LX stand, which is almost 40# all by itself.  I've had it for 13+ years though, and it's still bulletproof. </p> <p>Finally, all of this is hooked up with a 2x2 4K KVM from TESmart (HKS0402A1U-USBK). This works great because it allows me to either have both monitors on a single machine, or to split the two monitors between two machines and use the right hand \"Windows\" key to pop back and forth. It has a small remote control, but honestly, I just press the button the front when I have it set with both monitors attached to a single machine (the usual configuration).</p> <p>Separation of Work and Personal</p> <p> As tempting as it is, I'm a big believer in keeping a very strict separation between my work and personal devices.
