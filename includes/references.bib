	title = {Categorizing, {Analyzing}, and {Managing} {Third} {Party} {Trust}},
	volume = {44},
	url = {https://www.andysayler.com/output/pdf/trust-tprc44-paper.pdf},
	abstract = {The modern computing ecosystem requires users to trust a variety of third parties to complete
even the most basic of digital tasks. From system administers to service providers to device
manufactures, which third parties computer users must trust and the capabilities with which
they must trust them is a critical component underpinning the privacy and security of our digital
data. The rise of the “cloud” as the preferred platform for most modern computing applications
makes questions of trust even more complicated and pressing. A lack of understanding or
misplacement of such trust has the potential to lead to data leaks, questionable surveillance
practices, and a wide range of related privacy-harming events.
It is thus desirable from a public policy perspective to help individuals understand and
control third party trust and to minimize the likelihood of such trust being violated. Toward
these ends, this paper presents a model for describing third party trust and the likelihood of
trust violations. It applies this model to analyze the nature of third party trust across of a
variety of popular cloud services and uses it to categorize the common manners in which third
parties violate this trust. Finally, this paper presents a number of proposed techniques, both
technological and policy-based, to minimize the degree of trust users must place in third parties
as well as to decrease the likelihood of violation of this trust.},
